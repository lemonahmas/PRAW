Genshin characters simplified and shuffled|1
A bunch of people were saying that my previous post was too easy and they wanted a challenge, so in this one,

1. The order is all shuffled and no longer sorted by nation
2. All characters are made to be the same height
3. I removed one character, and added three NPCs

Have fun!

Daily Questions Megathread (April 09, 2024)|2
Ask about anything about the game that doesn't necessarily require a dedicated thread.

That is, if your question can be answered rather quickly/without significant  difficulty (e.g. "Can my phone run this game?"), ask here. If you think your question can contribute to some constructive discussions (e.g. "What do you think of Amber's combat efficiency? Here's my opinion."),  make a particular post with the "discussion" flair.

I'm trying to redesign the traveler kits, are these balanced.|0
i really like the traveler kits but i just feels like they're missing something so i decided to redesign them

Anemo Traveler: in this build i want him to be a reliable dps that can carry you early game as you will have a lack a characters

normal attacks: these are the same including the wind surge at the end of the combo, they will also have increased scaling

Elemental Skill: the crowd control effect is larger and whenever you swirl an enemy, your normal attacks get infused with said swirled element. (i'm still trying to decide whether the infusion stays on your on field character even after you switch)

Elemental Burst: the same but once you use it it increases the amount of hits your skill does and increases its radius

&#x200B;

Geo Traveler: i want this traveler to be a dps or a shielder not only to have parallels to zhongli, but also to give early game player more options. they will also be a catalyst user instead of a sword user

normal attacks: these are the same

Elemental skill: unleashes a big aoe of geo damage where if the enemies take a hit their defense decreases 

Elemental burst: creates a shield that scales off of hp and increases attack of the whole team

&#x200B;

Electro traveler: this traveler will be a battery, buff attack, and be a sword user

Normal attacks: these will be the same

Elemental skill: the same but when any character collects a magatama they're attack and energy regeneration rate will increase

Elemental burst: this will be the same

&#x200B;

Dendro traveler: i genuinely don't know how to make this kit better without making it just nahida so i will not change this one

&#x200B;

Hydro traveler: this traveler will be a claymore and healer

normal attacks: these are the same

Elemental skill:  drains the travelers hp by 30% and heals the active character the hp that the traveler drained from themself

Elemental burst: heals the entire team based on how low the teams current hp.

&#x200B;

these are all my traveler builds and i hope these are good enough to make traveler an actual viable character. and please give me balancing ideas in the replies i feel like i made some of these too overpowered.

Would different kinds of resin be an improvement to the resin system?|0
The thing about the resin system I dislike a lot is how much you have to spend your resin on. Like what if you still haven't fought your weekly boss yet, but you also need to artifact farm for a character, and get weapon/talent ascension material only available that day? Having to selectively choose what to spend your small amount of resin on is so painful and really makes leveling your characters/weapons slower and harder. My proposal would be different resin for different kinds of resin gated challenges. 

Different Resins:

1. Weekly boss resin
2. resin for normal bosses
3. artifact domain resin
4. talent domain resin
5. weapon domain resin

I feel like this would be fair. 180 resin each could really help people get stuff done and be able to equally distribute their resources.

Yo straight up, cat event is disappointing.|251
I wanted to name the cat Tofu! Fuck you Paimon, sick you naming everything.

Elso it's supposed to be an event about putting furniture together for cats, but there's only one correct combination? What's the point? They could have made this like the Aranara event where you come mix and match the items.

Not to mention Mona and other characters that show up aren't even voiced, just lazy all around.

I was hoping it'd be as good as the cooking event. =(

What are best Genshin Impact slander names?|221
We all love this game and thats why we’re here. No offense to anyone but sometimes we do get frustrated due to bad luck in gacha rng, Abyss runs or other bad luck in this game that makes some people create hilarious slander names. 

I saw one recently thats making me laugh out anytime I think of it, “Emblem of severe shit domain” 😂😂😂

The other one that stuck to me for a long time was “Staff of homeless” before they brought the weapon banner pity system

What are other funny slander names that you’ve seen or thought about yourselves?

AR60 Players Opinions/Ideas|0
So im making this post because im curious to see how other players like myself deal with the current state of the game. So for context im AR60 and have the necessary characters to clear any and all content, however I've never actually been the type to do that. I normally do up to floor 11 in abyss mainly especially if I'm trying to clear the BP and for events i only focus on the difficulty that will land the primogems. Nowadays i don't even do dailies, so as a another player said in a previous post, I'm not really playing the game.

So i guess what i want to know for players like myself what is your current goal, what keeps you playing. I play HSR more than Genshin but I think that's because of auto battles, plus the events aren't as time-gated.

Hero the Copy Cat|0
Ok here is a very briefly thought out concept of a 5 star I have been thinking of for a while. Almost definitely overpowered, but I wanted to balance that by making them a weird fit. Basically I image them as being a sub DPS and Support at the same time. I also want them to be from the new Pyro Nation along with this other character I have been thinking about to a much more in depth degree. Please tell me what you think about Hero! I really like the idea behind them but understand it would be hard to balance and implement.

Hero the Copy Cat (Cryo Catalyst, they/them)
- [ ] Normal attack: Makes ice versions of the physical weapons. 6 hit chain. First 2 are the sword, second 2 are spear, last 2 are a claymore.
- [ ] Charged attack: Freezes the air into an ice bow, rapidly charging a magic ice arrow. After charging like a normal bow, the arrow will create 3 ice clusters around the tip. When fired, the arrow will split into 3 homing projectiles.
- [ ] Plunging attack: Standard catalyst plunge, but upon landing there is an AOE visual effect of a mini Rosaría’s ult (no extra damage).
- [ ] Elemental Skill: Creates a small area of effect that enhances attack speed of allies within. Upon dealing damage, the active character (something you do with the Pyro Nation’s gimmick). Lasts for 6 seconds. Cooldown is 8 seconds.
- [ ] Burst: Calls upon their allies, imbuing their experiences and knowledge into ice sculptures the hero makes. Upon creation, these figures become animated and cast their elemental skills. These skills, however, become imbued with the cryo element (Furina’s summons will deal cryo damage instead of hydro). This resets cooldowns for the full team’s elemental skill. Increases damage of the skill by 150% for duration. If skill is used by the original character it will replace the current skill effects on the field (ie. If Furina takes the field after this ult and summons her pals, they will replace the cryo versions.) (If used in coop and there is more than one Hero on the team, then the inactive hero will be summoned to use their skill. If there is no inactive Hero [ie. both Hero’s are on the field] then no Hero copy will be created)
- [ ] Passive 1: The weapons summoned by Hero’s basic and charged attack become visual copies of their ally’s equipped weapons. This also grants a weakened version of those weapons’ passives the this character. If there are two units with the same type of weapon, one weapon will be chosen at random for the chain.
- [ ] Passive 2: The copies summoned by the burst will now stay around for a max of 5 secs where they will auto attack surrounding enemies using cryo versions of their weapons (deals only cryo damage and gains the weakened passive of their weapon. Hero cannot utilize Passive 1 until the copies fade. These copies have half the strength of the real versions. Can be destroyed if HP is reduced to 0) (This effect will not summon other versions of Hero. If there are two Hero’s on the team, the inactive Hero will be summoned, use their skill, then fade as if the active Hero did not have Passive 2. If there is no inactive Hero on the team, then no copy of Hero will be summoned).
- [ ] C1: If the full team is catalyst users, then Hero will summon only basic weapons, but their catalyst will switch between their allies’ catalysts for each of their 6 attacks (random order, always retains their original weapon’s passive). Charge attack is still the same. Passive 1 grants the full passive of the allies’ weapons to Hero.
- [ ] C2: Basic attack up 3 levels
- [ ] C3: 
- [ ] C4: 
- [ ] C5: Burst up 3 levels
- [ ] C6: Perfect Imitation. Each weapon Hero summons due to Passive 1 becomes a r5 version while Hero has it summoned. The stats of the passive are no longer weakened by the effects of Passive 1. Hero also adopts the fighting animation for their current teammates.
- [ ] Signature Weapon: Main stat= ATK. Passive= Gain stat buff for each team member with a different weapon type. Gain different stat buff for each unit with the same weapon type (catalyst)
- [ ] Idle animation: summons the cryo copies of their current teammates and poses with them to take a selfie.

Reached a bunch of key end game milestones all at once|0
Hoyo clearly did their math and have tuned the Genshin resource systems to take the amount of real world time they want it to take. I started in 3.8 and have always been struggling with having enough resources to build characters. I ended up buying two BPs because i wanted to speed things up.

All of these resource constraints suddenly cleared away in the past couple of weeks and I can finally relate to many of the end game players on this subreddit. 

* Built 10ish meta chars and hit 36 stars in the abyss last cycle. Don’t see myself hitting it every time though. 
* Weapon xp is building up (1.8k mystic ore now)  No longer need to farm and forge crystals all the time. 
* Artifact xp is plentiful. No longer need to wait to level to 20. Hit the artifact cap recently and I had to manage them for the first time.
* No longer gold constrained, and can easily throw resin into building random new characters. 
* I don’t feel like I really need new chars and so primos feel less important. Might try to get some cons or even a signature weapons or two in the future.

The game feels much more forgiving now. It doesn’t matter if I miss out on resin.

Still need a lot of xp books and character ascension mats for my other random chars. The ascension mats come slowly still and it’s silly having to convert them back and forth.

Who would you be in Genshin Impact?|11
If you could take the place of any character in Genshin Impact (playable or NPC), including all their powers, skills, history, and position who would it be?

I would honestly pick Yaoyao for having a pretty cool life. Being raised by the adepti and having a cute plushie companion seems pretty cool. And she doesn’t seem to be having any issues being raised by Madame Ping, who understands how to raise a child far better than Xianyun/Cloud Retainer did (ex: Shenhe during this year’s Lantern Rite).

My second choice would be Kazuha. No worries, traveling the land with a cool pirate crew seems like a pretty relaxing life.

Which burst would cause the most excruciating pain to the average human? I'm not talking about the ones that'd instantly end you like raiden or zhongli, but the ones that'd make u suffer like crazy.

Imo, it'd be alhaitham, having all those sharp dendro refracting things aggressively pierce you repeatedly.

Genshin Character Survey for Master Thesis|8
Hello everyone,

I am a Master student at Erasmus University and am currently writing my thesis. I have already posted my survey once in the [r/KaeyaMains](https://www.reddit.com/r/KaeyaMains/) subreddit, but I am still missing respondents, so I am posting it here now.

As a big fan of Genshin Impact myself, I decided to make my thesis about the game, more specifically the characters. The topic of my thesis is how one's favorite character in Genshin impact affects their transmedia (both in and out of game) behaviors towards the game such as buying merchandise or participating in the community.

Therefore, I am looking for players of Genshin Impact (18 years and older) to help me with my research. So, I wanted to ask you if you could be so kind as to answer my survey on this topic through the link below.

It takes about 10 minutes to complete and your responses will be a really big help and I would really appreciate it. If you have any questions feel free to email me at [FavCharacterImpact@gmail.com](mailto:FavCharacterImpact@gmail.com).

[https://erasmusuniversity.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_3ghFra6y4ruzY46](https://erasmusuniversity.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3ghFra6y4ruzY46)

Why is neuvillette so overpowered? |0
So i've been playing genshin for quite a while now (ar 57 and halfway to 58 now) and i own ayato, i recently started doing abyss runs for my casual friend (barely ar 55) who pulled neuvillette and even though my ayato is way more invested and has his signature, his neuvillette already deals almost the same amount of damage on a way worse build, is the gap really that big? I know everyone says he's way better than ayato, but this just feels unfair.

I got a theory about the Traveler, Heavenly Principles, and Celestia|2
We know that potentially Heavenly Principles might be the final boss, but what if it also been eroded like the many others and was also corrupted by forbidden knowledge. We know that Forbidden Knowledge is extremely toxic for the world of Teyvat as even Apep who had little knowledge was corrupted for centuries when King Dershert died and gave all the knowledge he had to her.

There's also the being known as the Sinner who has some connection to Forbidden Knowledge and Heavenly Principles in some way.

Now we got the Travelers, beings who might be far older than teyvat wielding a unique power,  who have traveled countless worlds seeing all kinds of beings, but little knowledge of where they are from. What if they come from the sames world as the Heavenly Principles along with other descenders. For some reason the 3rd got their power sealed and their corpse was used to amplify the captured powers of the dragon kings, but they probably arrived much earlier as maybe only Zhongli knows or at least heard of them during or before the Archon War.


What if the real final boss and cause of everything is because of whatever is contained in Forbidden Knowledge that makes even a powerful being like The Heavenly Principles act in such a way is related to how each of them arrived in teyvat.

So I have an account on ps that's linked to a hoyolab account, however when I try to log in on mobile and it says username or password incorrect even though I'm certified it's right. Now I thought about linking it to a gmail account and using that to log in easily on mobile but I can't figure out how as on ps it asks you to do so from the android device itself. Any ideas what I should do?
Am I way off base, or does anyone else find the new story quest with Chiori to be a bit lazy?|0
Don't get me wrong, the fashion show cutscene towards the end was pretty cool, and stylized, and I'm sure it took the artists a while to put together. But I've been knocking out story quests a lot lately and I can't help but notice that some other characters get fully animated scenes, I think Eula gets two, one of which she's literally weaving to dodge sniper fire and leaping up a tower in a pretty cool fight scene. Meanwhile, Chiori gets a still frame of her threatening a dude because they didn't want to go through the trouble of making her model crouch and pull a dude up by his tie?

Nothing kills my drive more to level something than seeing I have to wait 2 days to do so.   This system was bad on release, now it just feels like an ancient relic that needs to just be retired.

Returning player here, last played around when dragonspine was released. Sitting at AR35 probably 37 or 38 whenever I do my ascension quest. I’m struggling with damage throughout the game and I know it’s partly because I don’t have a good main DPS. I’m not super sure who to invest into currently given most of my heroes are supports. Any suggestions or help given the heroes I have?

My characters and build are too weak.Help|0
Hello.

Well, as it says in the title, I have reached that point where the world is more powerful than my characters and now I can barely do anything because if I try to farm materials it takes a long time and there are times when I can't even finish the palaces, I have I've been looking at guides on the internet but each guide tells me a different thing and I don't know which one to trust.  
 I left the game for 2 years and when I came back I saw that they have added the improvement guide to see what I should equip with each character.

&#x200B;

I attach a screenshot of the characters I have and the maximum level of each one.

Thanks in advance.

PvP Battle Royale- Who would win?|0
I have asked this before but I’m wondering now, since the game’s meta is very developed, a very simple question:

If all the characters of genshin were dropped into teyvat, Battle royale style. Assuming all characters were C6 and had the best artefacts, weapons, etc. and each player was of equal skill and had the same ping, etc etc..

Which character would come out on top?

- Character skill interactions would be the same as the Ei and Childe fights, so for example you cannot knock players up with venti’s elemental skill
- You are alone, you have no teammates. There are also no mobs or enemies to have as little interference as possible with the fighting.

And a second question, how would you balance PvP if hoyoverse decided to add it?

I got nuevilette and I want some feedback for my team ideas|0
- • Somehow I only got him on 17 pity, but as it was a ten pull there was of course the chance of a double. Which has happened for wriothesley as well (Fontaine characters love me for some reason) after shenhe I want to go for nilou or Raiden, whoever returns first.
- •
- • So anyway I have a few team ideas and I have yet to decide, I know I don't have to choose one but it's better for my resources and time to focus on just this team, whichever I decide on. since I hit early pity I have plenty of primos to spare
- •
 - • my " shopping list " even though there's no money involved just yet (supports only, not counting the main DPS types I want)
- • 
- • Raiden Shogun
- • nihada
- • nilou
- • shenhe
- • furina
- • kokomi
- • albedo if he ever returns
- •
- • I don't expect to get even half of these in the next year but my actual roster consists of all four stars apart from kaveh and Mika, I also have qiqi diluc jean and Mona unfortunately, and I have kazuha, zhongli, ayaka. And some main DPS, but they won't be useful here. Xiao, wriothesley, Eula. My team ideas are
- •
- • kazuha, nihada, nuevilette, kuki
- • yao Yao, Raiden, nuevilette, zhongli
- • ayaka, shenhe, nuevilette, kazuha
- • zhongli, furina, nuevilette, xiangling
- • nihada, yao yao, nuevilette, nilou
- • albedo, zhongli, nuevilette, furina
- • kuki, furina, nuevitte, zhongli
- •
- • im trying to make maybe 1 or 2 teams for each main dps I have and the idea is to have 1 or 2 of each element, currently the elements I have fully accounted for are cryo, anemo, pyro, i nuevilette is my first and only reliable hydro and im debating with myself if it's worth it to get a second just incase abyss highly demands of a specific element and I can use it on both floors, now are the DPS I am planning to have. I'm including this so you can know what supports will benefit me the most. The ones in *italics* are the ones I already have.

Title. so with that being said, how did genshin impact well impact your life?
why did it do that? 
thank you in advance 
Been away for far too long|0
Hey, I have played genshin for like 2 years and left on the release of water kamehameha guy. Anything changed in the game? Mechanics, endgame, modes, quality of life? Is it worth for me coming back? I left due to reasons that I find exploration too long and boring, and also because there is no endgame challenges that I can stick my teeth in. 
What are the Weapons that really necessary?|0
I'm new and F2P, my goal at the early game is to pull for the characters I'd love to play. I want to avoid those who rely too much on the weapons or some are really hard to build, can you guys name some of them so I can give a pass? I'm having enough to pull for Kazuha! Thank you very much.

What's a new type of exploration passive you hope they'll add for new characters in the future?|4
For me I'm hoping they can add a miner character that gains double the rocks/crystal chunks when they break them with their skill or basic attacks. Another one would be something similar to Topaz from HSR where they have a little pet that can find treasure chests around the map. Maybe someone from the Adventurer's guild, feels like it's been forever since we gotten a character from there. Pretty sure the last ones were Fischl and Bennett so the launch of the game.
Any tips for kazuha mains? |0
Which attribute should ii focus on? I just pulled him and fairly new to the game. A "friend" invited me to play but is not playing with me or helping me because he said im still to weak.

New player looking for advice|0
I've just started playing a couple of days ago and I've definitely noticed how a lot of big damage is tied into elemental reactions, since I'm pretty new I know that 5 stars and ideal artifacts are a long way away for me so could anyone just let me know what a good elemental combo would be for my four characters? Just something to cover the most bases I can because I keep getting stuck against bosses I can barely damage even when I'm above their level

Sorry for the wordy post, I just wanted to make sure I was saying it all right, thank you all in advance

But I mean the small, miniscule stuff that I might have missed. Maybe new game mechanics? Online discourse? Memes? Something to look out for when going back to play content I missed since the first Ayato banner? 

I’d love to read! 

For context: I’ve been a player since launch and I had to stop because I needed to focus on graduating from college.

Updated Magic Crystal Ore Farming Guide for Genshin Impact v4.5|132
**Preamble:**  
Hey everyone,

So here it is. After 3 weeks of investigation and research, my v4.5 MCO farming guide.

The main inspiration for this project was my inability to find any collected, comprehensive information for Magic Crystal Ore (MCO) farming that was more up to date than from 3 years ago, after Liyue had dropped.   
  
I'm currently in the process of trying to level up and ascend all of my weapons in the game, after having finished levelling all of my characters.   
To do this, I need to craft as much Mystic Enhancement Ore (MEO) as possible. So I was primarily trying to find the locations of Ore Locator (OL) NPCs in Inazuma, Sumeru, and Fontaine. But I was having great difficulty finding any lists of these NPCs anywhere online. Nor could I find much info on how the MCO system itself works, and how it can be taken advantage of. And when I did find anything, it was usually just a single piece of information separate from anything else, like a single NPC name.

I finally decided it was time to do it myself.

What I'll be covering here is:  
- How the MCO system works.  
- Locations of all OL NPCs that I've found so far, as of v4.5, and how OL NPCs interact with the MCO system.  
- Locations of potential MCO outcrops that have failed to be listed on the various interactive maps elsewhere online.  
- Providing gathered data on my experiences and investigations.

I would also like to link to the previously most in-depth guides.   
The first was created by u/AegisD!  
Mondstadt, Liyue, and Inazuma MCO farming guides:  
[https://imgur.com/a/Hf23qah](https://imgur.com/a/Hf23qah)  
More in-depth information about systems, and Leyline connection to MCO spawning:

And the second was made by u/AcidMagic:  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin\_Impact/comments/jyinrq/comprehensive\_guide\_to\_daily\_magic\_crystal\_ore/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/jyinrq/comprehensive_guide_to_daily_magic_crystal_ore/)  


Thirdly, I'd like to credit the contributors to AegisD's posts:  
u/stiltzkin for the visual design of his post's images.  
u/BlowITA for noticing the daily connection between leyline and MCO location.  
u/megajigglypuff7I4 for their [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/kdyt8x/daily_crystal_spawn_all_mechanics_explained/) on crystal mechanics.

But with all that context/credit out of the way, let's get started!

(I apologize for any poor screenshot quality. MY PC plays Genshin in HDR, and when I capture a screenshot, it can end up looking washed out.)



**How The MCO System Works:**  
Let's start with the basics. 

The MCO system controls how many MCO outcrop groups appear per day, when they appear, and where.

Everyday, exactly 2 hours after server reset, new MCO will spawn in-world at randomized locations in each region. 

Each region has a set number of MCO locations which spawn every day. They each have a much larger number of POTENTIAL locations for MCO to spawn, but only that region's set number will spawn each day; 6 for Mondstadt, 10 for Liyue, and then 8 each for Inazuma, Sumeru, and Fontaine.

Each of these MCO locations spawns 2-3 individual MCO outcrops, and each of these outcrops can drop anywhere from 1-3 MCO crystals that you can actually pick up. This means that each individual outcrop group can give you anywhere from 2 to 9 MCO crystals.

So, if you were to do a total map clearance of all available MCO outcrops in a given day, you could get as little as 80 MCO, or as many as 360 MCO. Though I almost always land somewhere in the 90s. But I will show my own experiences through data tables farther down below.

There is also apparently a link between the leylines that are active at the start of the new server day within each region, and which MCO locations have spawned in.   
If we use Inazuma as an example, then the two islands which have one wealth leyline and one EXP leyline will be the two islands that have the 8 MCO locations shared between them.   
\*I will note that this is old information, from previous updates. This may no longer be true, or it may be true here, yet not be true for the newer regions. I have yet to test this.

And it's also notable that outcrop groups seem to spawn together within sub-regions. It's inconsistent from major region to major region, but in some of them, after you get a good enough feel for the system, you'll start being able to tell where MCO outcrops will be before you see them, after locating your first few.

A good example is in Liyue's Guyun Stone Forest. If one of those outcrops spawns, it's almost guaranteed that all four of them will have done so. Etc.

This also leads directly into the usefulness of Ore Locator NPCs.



**Ore Locator NPCs:**  
Now, when I say "Ore Locator" NPC, what I refer to is an NPC who has the dialog option which will potentially reveal one or more nearby MCO outcrop groups. Most often, they will have the dialog option which reads "Is there anything noteworthy nearby?" (or some variation of that), which will always be next to a speech bubble with an exclamation point in it. Picture for reference:

[Average Ore Locator NPC Dialog.](https://preview.redd.it/9t4npui2z4tc1.jpg?width=3440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6fd49bea6e10ac51673e1266310124eccc6d94e0)

This is not the only dialog, however. Others will sometimes have different dialog, especially if they're the main blacksmith in the country/region.  
For example, Fontaine's blacksmith, Estelle, says "Tell me about Fontaine's mineral products." Here she is doing just that:

[Differing Ore Locator NPC Dialog.](https://preview.redd.it/rzj5nasuz4tc1.jpg?width=3440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=70718d710cd352726f7850783e40b005999b6210)

Now, how these OL NPCs work within the greater MCO system is that they will only ever identify MCO. Not any other kind of metal or ore.  
I thought originally, before I had experienced the system much, that they were just noting any rare ores, or even regional ores, like Liyue's Cor Lapis or Noctilucous Jade, or Fontaine's Condessence Crystal.

But no, they only locate MCO.

Not only that, but using them to locate your MCO can shorten your farming time significantly.   
Instead of having to search every MCO location you've memorized, or that has been noted on the interactive maps, they will point you directly to ones that have definitely spawned. That, paired with the fact that often whole sub-regions of MCO will spawn together, can really cut down your time spent on the task.

It's also notable that the main blacksmith of each region is guaranteed to give you 3-5 locations every day (the exact number depending on region) as they are capable of locating all MCO across their whole major region. But many of the other OL NPCs often won't give you any locations at all, because they each only monitor a certain sub-region within the greater major region. And if no ore has spawned within their specific sub-region, they won't have any ore to locate for you.  
But I've found personally that talking to them is still faster than going to every location independently, and even if you don't get any locations from one of them it can still help you rule out a whole sub-region.



**Ore Locator NPC Locations:**  
The following is a list of all the NPCs I've found which had the OL dialog option, marked in red circles and text:

**Unmarked MCO:**  
When I say "Unmarked MCO", what I mean is that these are MCO locations I've found which are not yet marked on the various Genshin Interactive maps I've seen online.

I've tried adding them, or sending in suggestions for new map pins, but so far have had no luck.

These are just the ones I've found so far. I'm sure I'll add more as time goes on. And if anyone is aware of additional ones, please say so down in the comments.

**Data:**

Next, I'll be providing my experimental data. This took place over the course of this last week. I recorded how many MCO locations I found each day, per region. And I also recorded how much MCO I had gathered per map clearance.

Mondstadt:  
Apr. 1 – 6 outcrop groups  
Apr. 2 – 6 outcrop groups  
Apr. 3 – 6 outcrop groups  
Apr. 4 – 6 outcrop groups  
Apr. 5 – 6 outcrop groups  
Apr. 6 – 6 outcrop groups  
Apr. 7 – 6 outcrop groups

Liyue:  
Apr. 1 – 8 outcrop groups  
Apr. 2 – 10 outcrop groups  
Apr. 3 – 10 outcrop groups  
Apr. 4 – 10 outcrop groups  
Apr. 5 – 10 outcrop groups  
Apr. 6 – 10 outcrop groups  
Apr. 7 – 10 outcrop groups

Inazuma:  
Apr. 1 – 8 outcrop groups  
Apr. 2 – 8 outcrop groups  
Apr. 3 – 8 outcrop groups  
Apr. 4 – 8 outcrop groups  
Apr. 5 – 8 outcrop groups  
Apr. 6 – 8 outcrop groups  
Apr. 7 – 8 outcrop groups

Sumeru:   
Apr. 1 – 8 outcrop groups  
Apr. 2 – 8 outcrop groups  
Apr. 3 – 8 outcrop groups  
Apr. 4 – 8 outcrop groups  
Apr. 5 – 8 outcrop groups  
Apr. 6 – 8 outcrop groups  
Apr. 7 – 8 outcrop groups

Fontaine:  
Apr. 1 – 8 outcrop groups  
Apr. 2 – 8 outcrop groups  
Apr. 3 – 8 outcrop groups  
Apr. 4 – 8 outcrop groups  
Apr. 5 – 8 outcrop groups  
Apr. 6 – 8 outcrop groups  
Apr. 7 – 8 outcrop groups

Total MCO:  
Apr. 1 – 84 MCO  
Apr. 2 – 99 MCO  
Apr. 3 – 98  MCO  
Apr. 4 – 107 MCO  
Apr. 5 – 92 MCO  
Apr. 6 – 88 MCO  
Apr. 7 – 104 MCO

As you can see, at the start, I think I missed 2 locations in Liyue. This is likely because I had missed some spawn locations, and not because they hadn't appeared. I also had not yet discovered that single unmarked MCO location, or Shushan, the new ore locator NPC in Chenyu Vale.

And the average MCO gain per map clearance seems to be 96. Though 7 data points is a small pool. I could refine this further if I keep track of it. Will I, though? Only time will tell. Lol.

I’m starting over and wanted suggestions!|0
I decided to start over because my old account was boring after whaling for the best teams. This time around I was thinking of being free 2 play or should I go with low spending just to get my favorite characters again. I am not gonna use zhongli and hu tao because they were way to overused in my old one and want to start over. I already rerolled for chiori and Eula and I eventually got Eulas weapon after all the beginning quests. Any suggestions for my second go at genshin? I am looking to just explore and enjoy the world a second time since I don’t remember the story that well and I never did side quests or lore readings. And I originally stopped playing by 3.5

I’m giving up on world quests |0
This is a rant. 

So irritated with world quests that I’ve decided I’m not doing them anymore. 

Some that have to be completed through the daily commissions never come. I’ve even set commissions to a specific area and checked daily for months and nothing I need comes. Some of these aren’t even listed on the reputation rewards lists while some of them are, and I can’t unlock those until the previous quests present themselves. And going to the NPCs to try to trigger the quests don’t work. Additionally, aside from the uncomprehensive reputation rewards list, there’s no way to check to see what quests have been completed.   

Outside of commission quests, I never see the exclamation marks on the map anymore for other world quests. 

I think they need to revisit the world quest format and make a few changes here. This area can definitely be improved.

Folks, I am a day1 genshin player that was feeling a bit bored prior to inazuma release

Decided to give the game another shot today and played for ~8h just unlocking the map mostly.

But I am feeling a bit overwhelmed with so many new mechanics in each zone for example. What is the best way to get up to speed and learn everything new? Any tips on which order to go through the new zones?

The last time we saw a new Harbinger use a delusion was almost 4 years ago|0
With Arlecchino coming out soon, we might see the end of our delusion drought.

For context, the only Harbingers we've seen use their delusions are Childe and Signora. We saw Signora first use her Cryo delusion at the end of the prologue, and then again in the boss fight. With Childe, we saw his first use in the boss fight, and since then he's used both his delusion and Foul Legacy a few times in story quests and archon quests.

But might I remind you that these events were released during launch and 1.1 respectively; that means it has almost been four years since we've seen a new Harbinger use a delusion. And this is despite seeing a few new Harbingers since, well, basically launch.

Kind of weird that Hoyo would refrain from giving us a look at the unique powers of new characters from the most popular villains in the game for so long.

Spending a Weekend with Genshin's "Target Audience"|933
Any time there's a discussion about endgame, the lack of difficulty, and/or how everything keeps getting watered down, there's one point that gets used like a White Knight's Excalibur: "Genshin is a casual game, and people who want *X* aren't the target demographic.

So, I decided to see what life is like for Genshin's apparent "Target Demographic", and I spent the weekend doing coop. And I mean, a LOT of coop.  50 different coop games, to be exact.

Here's the parameters of my non-scientific study:

First, this was based in NA.

Second, It was English Speakers only.  My Spanish is terrible and my Portuguese is non existent.

Third, I picked players between AR25 and AR40.  I figured there would be more casual players there as opposed to the AR60 lot, and most high AR players reject world join requests.

Finally, I would offer to help with anything needed (bosses, Domains, etc) and then ask some questions.  Questions were:

How long have you played?

What do you like to do in Genshin?

What do you spend most of your time doing?

Have you ever spent anything on the game?

I'd also take a peek a map progression and whatnot, so see if I could formulate any opinions around that.

I don't want this to turn into a research study based on informal and anecdotal data, but here's the findings that stood out.

-----

Most people joined during Sumeru, which makes sense for the AR Levels.

The top thing people liked doing?  Running around and "exploring" the map or doing the quests.

The Exploration thing threw me for a loop.  In almost every world, there were chests and Oculi literally everywhere.  Like, most of the maps, even in the early areas of the game, were almost untouched.  Also, very few teleporters were unlocked -- I'm assuming just ones used during events.

The most common Limited 5 Star I saw was Furina.  However, the most popular character (by a wide margin) was The Traveler.  Outside of that, I did see a few Xianglings.

When asked if people needed help with Bosses, the most common bosses fought were the Oceanid, the Geo Hypostasis, and the Electro Hypostasis.  I didn't ask who they were farming for, though.

Finally, the big question... How many of these people spend?

Out of 50 players, 1 had purchased the Welkin twice, 1 had purchased a Welkin and a Battle Pass, and 1 said they were a regular Welkin player.

The other 47 all said they were f2p, although 2 did ask if I would buy them welkins or primos.  I did buy one a Welkin, because they were very nice and said they wanted Arlecchino.

So, that was my 100% Resinless Behavior this weekend.  I guess I learned that there is a large portion of the player base that is casual beyond comparison.  I still didn't get a good understanding on why content would be focused on them, as they seemed to spend so little. I guess Hoyoverse has the math figured out, though.

Only once. They give an items thats works just like Wanderer's name changing card. Make it a reward for hitting AR 60.i know they like us to be playing Genshin 24/7 so give us something worthwhile. 

I was young and stupid when i started but now i have changed as a person and i cant play with aether as MC. 

Edit:
Sorry for the bad wording regarding my post. I just need to clarify some things.

I choose aether solely because he is a male as me. I didnt want to choose lumine because she ia a female and a man cant play as a girl in my community ( this is a stupid mentality glad i dont care about people opinion anymore)

 I like to put MC in my teams. however, i dislike aether design and i love lumine design ( sorry aether main).

New end game suggestion #6543|0
I was thinking about them not wanting to stress players with another end game combat activity.

What if they had an end game that’s 2 end game paths running parallel to each other? You can choose at the beginning which quest line you follow but the end rewards would be the same either path.

Path 1: this could be a repeatable combat end game. People have had a million suggestions for this and I have ideas for it as well so I’ll leave this one open to imagination.

Path 2: for this I imagined how OSRS incorporated skilling into their end game raids. Like it could be as simple as helping set up a giant banquet so you get a big list of food that you have to cook, (like 10 sweet madames, 8 mondstat hash browns, etc.) or something that incorporates how we can harvest wood, and create some kind of bonfire thing.

End game doesn’t have to ONLY be combat, just had some shower thoughts.
Archon Quest Chapter IV: Act I Conclusion|0
Ok, I don't want to start off by saying I hated this act because by no means did I - I LOVED the court trial and the cutscenes were beautiful as always. 

HOWEVER,

I absolutely HATE how Traveler acted through this act, *especially* at the end. I feel like this was the first time I saw him really just straight up not like another main character for one mistake, and I honestly don't understand why. His resentment towards Lynney and Lynette is just abhorrent, like yes they lied to you about being Fatui, and yes you and your sister have some weird entanglement with the Fatui, but you know WHO ELSE is Fatui??? Childe. And he doesn't have any problems with him, even after having a huge boss battle fight. Where on the other hand Lynney has been kind and courteous to him since the moment Traveler set foot in Fontaine. And then to make it even worse, he denies wanting to work on the cold case with Navia, acting like there's not point and it's not what he went there to do, when Traveler literally always ends up on side quests that lead to the main thing, and it's happened throughout the whole game. I think even Paimon thought how he was acting was weird and cold when they said their final goodbyes to Lynney and Lynette. 

Sorry for ranting but that really pissed me off for some reason and I hope that he gets the f\*ck over himself.

Retracing bolide interaction|0
Hello! i have a quite simple question, Retracing Bolide 2 piece gives 35% shield strength but is that only for the character or the shield they create for other characters aswell?

Thank you!
Say that we got "team composition" voice lines. What would you want certain characters to say to each other?|395
To put forth an example, in HSR, if you add Guinaifen to a team with Sushang, she says a special line. The same thing happens if you add Herta to a team with Ruan Mei (or vice versa). The list goes on.

Now imagine if such a thing were done in Genshin when you're changing up your team. Imagine if Zhongli said something special when you add him to a team with Hu Tao. Or if you add Fischl to a team with Mona in it, you get some unique dialogue. There's all sorts of combinations that could be done.

So, for fun, what kinds of lines would you want to see out of such a change?

Here are a few examples I thought of:

- Lisa added to a team with the Traveler: "Need a helping hand, cutie?"
- Shinobu added to a team with Itto: "Let me handle this, boss."
- Itto added to a team with Shinobu: "Don't worry, Shinobu. I've got this."
- Itto added to a team with Ayato: "Ayato, my bro! My man!"
- Sara added to a team with Raiden: "At your command, Your Excellency."
- Gorou added to a team with Kokomi: "At your beck and call, Lady Kokomi!"
- Zhongli added to a team with Hu Tao: "Do you have need of me, Director?"
- Dehya added to a team with Candace: "Just like old times, Candace?"
- Amber added to a team with Eula: "I've got your back, Eula!"
- Lyney added to a team with Lynette: "Ready for the show, Lynette?"
- Qiqi added to a team with Hu Tao: "Not you again..."
- Diluc added to a team with Kaeya: "As if my day weren't troublesome enough..."

With Arlecchino’s banner right around the corner I was wondering what 4-stars she’ll have. It’s makes a lot of sense that she’ll probably have her children on it but I have not too big of a fan of those characters(playstyle wise). 
And I was thinking if you could choose the four star characters to be on the next banner, regardless of when their last re-ran or how well they synergize with their five star. Just 3 4-stars you want or constellations for, who would it be
Mine would be Charlotte, Kirara, and Chevreuse

I realize different people like different things and a lot of people dislike abyss. I used to hope that Mihoyo would increase the difficulty of abyss but then I thought about all the people who dislike it. So I started to set abyss challenges that make the combat more engaging and difficult for myself. Sometimes the answer to personal wants is right in front of you and it doesn't affect anyone elses experience.









The rules to the challenge this time were:                     






No repeat characters and limited to 1 five star character and 2 four stars characters per side.

My “Rule of Three” Suggestions to Improve the Experience of New, Current, Returning, and Future Players|0
Genshin Impact is a massive game, and the first of its kind that I’ve ever played - be that both in terms of the gacha component and the sheer scope of its open world.

I came into the game a few years after hearing about it from a couple of friends - they joined at release and I joined during the last half of patch 4.0. 

I honestly thought the game would be a typical JRPG in the vein of the Tales series - I truly went in blind having seen no content of it over the years, and only having the cover art to go on, having long forgotten any particulars my friends may have mentioned to me back then. Worry not though, as those misconceptions have long since been allayed, and need not be a source of contention here 🙂‍↕️.

That said, I’m among the group of folks that overall really enjoys the story, lore, and characters, as well as the dynamic interaction and relationships between the Traveler and these characters, and among the assorted characters themselves - both playable and npc. Yes, the story and at times bloated dialogue have their flaws, but I’ve enjoyed much of the game to date, and had a particular blast during the Sumeru and Fontaine Archon quests.

Joining the game at such a late stage has both its pros - namely the hours of content one has at their disposal, and cons - for example, the hours of content one has to complete to reach limited events for both their content and rewards if they want said content to remain spoiler free. 😅🥲

Broadly speaking, the following changes and additions to Genshin would personally appeal to me, and I think they objectively make sense to improve the experience of the new, current, returning, and future player base:

**Playable Past Limited Time Events**

I know it’s likely impossible to keep all these limited events in the main game, both due to size constraints and how the game takes over common areas for these events, leading to potential co-op and quest clashing. However, much of the content of past limited events is just fantastic - lore, characters meeting for the first time, learning more about character relationships, just loads of fun and interesting things all locked away by the inevitable march of time. 🫠

Personally I didn’t learn about past limited events until months into playing, and I’ve since caught myself up by watching videos. It would’ve been a much more enjoyable experience to play through these events myself though. 🥹

It should be possible for players to download past Limited Time Events separately as their personal space permits. The player need only sign in or enter their UID in this separate game space to have access to their characters and items - this can also be limited if there are constraints - like a domain space where you can only bring up to 4 characters; food/potion items can also be limited dependent on how much combat is required for the event. After completion, players can receive the event rewards as in-game mail to their account.

This method will avoid clashing of the same area and/or characters being used in one’s main game and the event, as well as permit device space in terms of allowing players to offload events once completed, making room for the next one. 

In terms of rewards, the player should receive the 4-star weapon if included in a particular event after completing it, as well as the usual amount of primos, exp books, mora, etc. available during the story component of the event. Also included should be any furnishing components, recipes, or other specialty/limited items if they’re not available for purchase via other means - e.g. gem shops, Serenitea Pot, etc. Whether a character should be included if they were the reward of an original event or not is debatable, but the rest is certainly reasonable.

**A Proper Quest Guide**

Yes, if players have the wherewithal and desire they can use a guide to hit every available major quest content in order, but for people who go into the game blind, having a more comprehensive quest overview would be nice.

This could be by region - once you unlock the first statue of the seven of a nation you get a list, which can simply give the name and order in which the archon quests and interspersed flagship/major chain world event quests were released in said nation, such that players can tackle them in a more logical order if they wish.

Bonus addition would be to include the general length of time the quest may take to complete so players can plan engaging in these quests and their time accordingly. 
 
I hopped all over the map hauling myself to Fontaine some weeks after joining the game to participate in minor, but reward heavy, events.

I had a good time doing any quest that randomly popped up or that I haplessly got myself into, but that put lore and story items all over the place for me too. This isn’t terrible by any means, and I’ve since re-sorted the timing of key lore and story items in my head, but I certainly would’ve played the game more in its release order and enjoyed it more in this regard if these two game additions had been available to me.

**Re-Playable Story Quests**

Yes, I really do enjoy the story and characters, and all the amazing voiced content - I play with JP audio, my niece and nephew with EN audio, and I’ve tried the CN and Korean audios as well - to each their own with their audio preference(s). 

I’m glad the hangout events are replay-able - especially the later ones that are longer and more complex - well, at least akin to story quests. I think it would be great to replay story quests too. We all have one or more favorite characters who we may enjoy hanging out with again via their story quest if already completed, or may not want to sit on story quests in fear of not having something to do later, especially during a dry period. Also, it’d be nice to refresh myself on some of the characters who I don’t have and just want to interact with again. 

**Inter-Character Dialogue**

Because it wouldn’t be a proper **Rule of Three** without some **Random Fourth Addition** when you think it’s over…

I love the bonus dialogue you get between characters and the Traveler in the Serenitea Pot as you raise their companionship level. The dialogue you get when they give you gifts from furnishing sets is also nice.

I think a phenomenal addition to this would be having inter-character dialogue - preferably voiced. Characters who know each other can exchange a few lines when chatting in the Serenitea Pot. It’d be great if characters could interact like this across Serenitea Pots as well - so even if you don’t have a certain character yourself, you can still chat with them as an appropriate friend/acquaintance character in someone else’s Serenitea Pot and get that dialogue exchange. 

This can be something that’s allowed generally in co-op, only among friends, or even locked behind having the interacting characters be at or above a certain friendship level - even if it’s the max of 10. An achievement or three can even be tied to these exchanges.

I think this would be great in fostering more Serenitea Pot co-op interactions, and just open up more content for players who enjoy this sort of thing. 

Bonus if they implement “friendship gift sets” for the Serenitea Pot alongside this where a certain furnishing set is favored by two or more friends and, if you have all characters in the realm together, they meet up, chat together and with you, and give you an amazing gift of primos, gems, and other rewards. 

The furnishings for these sets - which will have some meaningful significance to the friends (e.g. a replica of The House of Deana Library which Kaveh, Alhaitham, Cyno, and Tignahri can meetup in to reminisce about their Akademia student days) - can be gold mats and require more high quality and/or numerical material to make. The need to have more characters to satisfy this may also encourage players to get more characters, which isn’t bad from a business perspective. 

Or, if possible, these “friendship gift sets” can be part of the co-op series and can be achieved either alone or via co-op. So it’s more player friendly.  

Well, that’s all I have in terms of some significant changes I’d love to see.

Do you have 3-4… or 1-2… suggestions that would improve Genshin for you personally or that you think would just be a positive implementation?

Happy to read your thoughts and/or hear your feedback on mine. 😄

Wanna rant a bit about my bad luck|0
So I saved 49k primos + 38 fates and at 70ish pity when neuvi banner started last Tuesday 

Got c1 after losing 3 50/50s, and his weapon after getting freedom sworn and amos 

Tomorrow is my birthday so I brought the cheapest and 3rd cheapest pack as sort of a present to myself, and to try my 5050 luck since I'm at 69 pity 

...

And my dehya is c2

My first c6r1 project only costed me welkins and 3 runs, I guess neuvi is gonna take even more longer and more expensive now =<

I can't believe how beautiful this game is..... |16
I have always been a big fan of open world games and I checked Genshin out last month for the first time for this lone reason. And I still can't believe how they managed to make a f2p mobile game this stunningly beautiful. 

The world is superbly amazing, filled with content to the brim and just so beautiful to explore and on top of it all, THIS IS COMING FROM A MOBILE PLAYER. I watched a video recently, link is below. It blew mind on the beauty and variety of this world. 

https://youtu.be/vpWc0rMIp-E?si=Y4IGt3TQ1_OjRQyj

Hats off to Mihoyo for making this game free to play. 10/10 open world, amazing music as well to accompany it. I won't comment on the combat or the lore, I came here for exploration and adventure and I never want to leave. 

Things like pay-to-get-the-best-characters-and-gear or 'gacha game' simply don't matter to me. It may be a gacha game but it's damn well an absolutely beautiful gacha game. Anyways, this was just an appreciation post from me, thank you Mihoyo.

This one. I especially love the second part of it, after the sacrifice but I couldn't find this piece in the official albums. I'm quite saddened by it because it's such a beautiful soundtrack. Maybe it exists and I failed to find it. If not, do you think that they will add it later?

Havent played in a a long time, have good choice of characters but not sure who to use(dont know if correct flair)|0
Hello everyone! As the title mentions i havent played Genshin in a while and when i reinstalled it i noticed i have good characters but no artifacts. i gave my sister the account and all she did was pull and do events so im good on continuing the story . But since i see so many new characters on my account i wondered about who are good and who i should build.

  
also i dont intend to flex(dont know if this even counts), i just havent played since inazuma ended and kinda forgot everything , i started to play since tartaglia came out as a boss . I provided an image and text wall for those interested

Also if the information for good comps / meta/ or whatnot is available online , a link would be good enough

its just my friends told me that my team sucks( razor, kazuha, qiqi, xinqui) and i forgot how the game works.

Geo Black Serpent Knight|0

Lazy resinless Sunday|6
While I was waiting for the geo cube to respawn and a few more ticks of resin, I decided to experiment a little. I've just used Furina to walk from teleport to the geo cube for convenience, and I got curious whether it was possible to cross the sea between Liyue and Inazuma... So I did! It took a while, but since Furina can refresh the skill to keep it up on full duration, it was a walk in the... Sea? You can even switch alignments during the walk to have some respite from the dullness of the open sea; although it was fun to see the Alcor disappear in the fog, and Inazuma get clearer and clearer, the statue upon the cliff a sort of landmark to aim for. I switched course towards the harbour towards the end however  and I can only imagine the reaction if anyone saw a woman casually strutting it atop the sea.

My memory tells me that I once tried this with Kaeya or Ganyu a year or two ago and it wasn't possible. Did it get changed or is my memory just bad?

Small but Strange Detail in the Travail Trailer|0
I was rewatching the story chapter trailer and noticed that sumeru's chapter was the only one (of the ones we have access to so far) whose chapter name is not the same as one of the acts in their region's archon quest.

&#x200B;

The prologue, chapter 1, 2, and 4 all use one of the acts as their chapter name so it made me curious if there was some known reason for this (like a translation change or rewrite) or if there was some reason lore wise for that.  I feel like it's easy to write off as a simple change but fontaine returning to this pattern makes me think there's some intentionality behind it.  

I guess that we would have to wait for natlan and see if it holds but it makes me curious if anyone knows or had any ideas for why that would happen?

A week ago, there was an interview with Xiao Louhao, head of the writing team for Genshin, discussed a few things about Genshin's story development and 2 things that catch my eyes was

\- The burning Irminsul in Winter Night Lazzo video, it wasn't just Collei's dream, but in fact, it will be in future content

\- He write a really really long story for Genshin, even when he leave the company, his successor can still follow the plot, and all the contents we experiences so far, is just one third of it

      Hello may I ask, do the timers on food buffs like Omurice Waltz stack? For example if I eat one then it will last for 25mins right? But if I eat two from the start would it last for 50 mins straight? Orrr do I have to eat one every 25 mins to keep the buff active. And if yes does it work on other foods as well?

Lmk if this post isn’t allowed.

Hello, mobile player here. I played against the same weekly npc multiple times and kept encountering the same bug. At a certain point in the games it stops letting me use any skills despite it being my turn. It lets me switch characters, play cards, and end my round but it won’t let me use skills. I play this mode somewhat often but this hasn’t happened before. Each time it happened it would leave that gold, swirly icon on the active character. Has anyone else encountered this? How would I go about reporting this?

A Tier list I made based on how much I like their designs. They're not placed in any order within the tiers. I just kind of placed them.

(Last Year Recap) Official 2023 CN Birthday Web Event Shorts: Dehya|102

Dehya vs Zhongli for Neuv|0
I’ve been wondering if there really is a huge difference between Dehya and Zhong on a neuv team. I know the general best team structure for him at C0 is Neuvilette/Kazuha or Sucrose/Off field DPS/Shielder, but since I lack Zhong I’ve been using Dehya for interruption resist. It makes me wonder, if both of them basically just exist to give interruption resist, and they never really burst since it’s a DPS loss, then isn’t the only difference Zhong’s RES shred vs Dehya’s vapes and coordinated attacks? 

It’s my understanding that Zhong’s shred is pretty strong and Dehya’s damage is pretty trash, though I do have her C1, is the difference between the two negligible? I’ve heard the archons are re-running soon and I think I want to get Furina next, but if Zhong would significantly improve this team he may be the better choice.
To my previous post |0
So many on my last post saying I'm leading on attracting creeps or I'm not being honest seriously? Just because I complained about getting weird people flirting being weird to me over the past years I've played and complained on the blocklist being max to 10 people which is generally a weird thing to set it to. 

Apparently logic is since no one else complains I'm the one who's at fault like??? 

Also picture is cuz so many said it was something wrong with my profile or something 


It's not fun at everyone turning agaisnt me when all I wanted was to make a statement about the blocklist and just mention I've encountered some weird people 

If anyone finds or has art of Dehya doing this - trying on fancy dresses and changing her makeup - plz send. |13

Genuinely asking because I’ve spent money on this game to build up my team and collect characters, but I’ve also taken almost a year break from it and wish I could start the storyline over without giving up all of the characters I’ve earned since I started playing. Even if there were storyline/level restrictions on the characters I have I’d be fine with it as long as I don’t have to spend money again honestly.

So I’ve just started playing this game about a month or so ago. (Yes I’ve jump started my account a bit) Lol so far these are the characters that I’ve pulled. However I will be going F2P for a few months. And won’t be obtaining many new characters. I’ve watched plenty videos on how I need to manage my resources and limit myself to only building a select few characters at the beginning. Maybe I could get a few suggestions on  making two teams using only characters that I have that could eventually full star the abyss.

So how does everyone else seem to have so many??? Please help, I’ve got like 26 4+star characters but no 5 star!

Well people it's about that time: And what is your POPULAR opinion about Genshin Impact...?|0
So the opposite of unpopular opinion, instead of saying something negative y'all would say something positive that you really like about Genshin Impact. I'll start first, the game is amazing to look at, it's aesthetic is amazing...! It's not Red Dead Redemption 2, but it's still amazing regardless.

Is it playable with WinBootMate ? |0
So am planning to sell my old laptop and get a mac (work stuff) but I can’t play it on my phone neither as an iPad app on the mac (technically I can but I suck without the normal PC controls and mappings) and dual boot is removed from M based models 🥲

Currently I’ve read about the WinBootMate and how it can allow me to run portable windows on the mac, but is genshin playable on it? 

My planned hardware specs are: M1 Pro, 16 GB unified memory.
Inazuma is confusing |0
I'm newish to the game (started last month,AR 43) and I finally just got to Inazuma today. 

I did the story until I could actually explore and then I was driving a boat(??) then I was flying on an Electro thing and randomly got teleported to a boss and then I couldn't figure out how to leave outside teleporting but i hadnt unlocked any teleport points near where i was yet and then I died 

This is gonna be fun!!

why is there a cavalry in monstadt but no horses. and there are wagons everywhere but people drag it themselves. they got unlimited grass and the only flat region in teyvat, why don't they breed horses or pigs or else? and no sled dogs? why people just prefer to go by foot through the forests with monsters and evil wizards and giant robots and flying orbs killing everybody? why people in teyvat are using gliders but don't use grappling hook or something? just climbing on a damn mountains? liyue is full of businessmans and they are like "oh i'm late for an important deal time for a parkour"? and there are teleports everywhere and they are placed in cities but no one have a clue what is that, but we know, but it's a game convention, but then it's NOT and dainsleif and caterina just asks us about using teleports and IT MAKES SO MUCH PLOT HOLES IT'S LIKE IF DAINSLEIF WOULD SAY "DON'T YOU SEE THAT HILICHURL FAR AWAY?

How to get better at the game and level up quick?|20
I have barely played any of this game. I am currently at AR27. Rather recently, my sister told me she plays as well, and she is at AR56. I keep asking her to play with me, and we do play, but I feel like this might be boring for her because she pretty much one shots everything. I want to level up and get better at this game so I can make it less boring for her. What are some tips or resources you can give me to level up and learn more about the game? Thank you in advance, and have a nice day!

What do you think about buying boss ascension materials in event shop ?|0
Some players want to upgrade certain characters but they need to clear some quests in order to unlock the boss to farm materials.

Since most them dont have time to clear those quests, what do you think if we could buy boss material in the event shop ?

Like you play mini games, you obtain currency and you go to event shop to buy them.

Looking for decks to prepare for the Prince Cup?|4
For those wishing to have a try in the Prince Cup but unsure about deck choices, I'm more than happy to share a few of my recent go-tos. Feel free to drop your thoughts, but just saying, pretty sure I'm invincible in this upcoming comp.😆

1. My recent fav OTK deck 

code: FFAh1RYUEZGRSSoNEpCg2ZcTE4EBODANE7AR9DMPE0EwCMkQDIGQO8oTDbEQTNEUDcAA

Replaced defensive cards with more dice-gaining and card-drawing methods to maximize round 2 OTK potential.

Usually starts with Lyney's enhanced atk then switches to seahorse and places Liben for the round1.  
Then it's Jeht's showtime of round 2 with 6-8 aggro atks. Ez OTK.

https://preview.redd.it/ypvqvp0elvsc1.png?width=831&format=png&auto=webp&s=32a6c123cbcbb1bea71a2b8a9c7b1c254e73abd5

2. Classic shonen gang  
code: AFCg1QQUAZGwSZcNE5AB2TATE4ERODMTE6Aw9MMPDECQ9ckQDIGgCMoTDbEQTNEUDcAA

Highly recommended for competitive games. Great control ability with Xingqiu and Chongyun and a great finisher Razer. Since there's no food, save your HP in the first 2 rounds by using controls and seek to finish with Chongyun or Razer's burst in the 3rd round. Need some practice to learn to get through the weak early rounds. Don't be greedy for Xingqiu's burst then lose too much HP.

https://preview.redd.it/zl0ajjrelvsc1.png?width=831&format=png&auto=webp&s=79177fa5d15044df04843e5f4d2a8b87e131d335

3.  code:AFCg1QQUAZGwSZcNE5AB2TATE4ERODMTE6Aw9MMPDECQ9ckQDIGgCMoTDbEQTNEUDcAA

A revised version of this meta deck. As a deck that's been OP for several versions, I've noticed this deck has been more popular since 4.5. Probably because its counters Lyney, Fischl, and Nahida decks on the weak side now. Usually start with Yelan's burst at round 2 then switch to thunder manifestation. Very solid competitive deck but need some practice to learn how to manage the resources in certain situations.

Minor spoiler alert ahead (Jeht/Sumeru post)|0
>!First off, I just wanna say, I have never enjoyed killing a character as much as I did Matriarch Babel!<

  
Second, unlike most people I thoroughly enjoyed the aranara quest to save Rana, but the fact that >!she gets a vision for just sleeping through it, and Jeht, who went through everything she went through, found the fucking eternal oasis, unlocked the grand mausoleum of king deshret, anihilated an entire fucking tribe, single handedly mass-murdered the fauti GETS NOTHING?!?!?!?! !<

  
In the past I would constantly see posts of people saying Jeht needs to be a playable character, and I always just thought they thought she was hot because I had only played the Jebrael/Jeht section of her story, but I just finished the entire thing today, and good lord, Mihoyo does some incomprehendable shit some time

  
On an unrelated note, I still cannot FUCKING BELIEVE, that Ningguang is a 4 star

To this day, Fabulous Fungus Frenzy remains my favorite Genshin event of all time|10
The story alone was quirky and captivating: Layla as our ever-sleepy sidekick, Bongo-Head and Twirly-Whirly as our little mascots, Yae Miko as our shady ally, Dori as our opportunistic tipster, Haniyyah as our rival with a redemption story. There was a mystery to be unraveled, and a surprisingly dark resolution for the true antagonist. The atmosphere was very Pokémon in the best way possible.

A key conceit that Fabulous Fungus Frenzy got right, and that follow-up events simply did not do, was allowing us to run around and "fight" in the same arena as our shroom buddies. There was nothing quite like stepping into an otherworldly plant-domain, hearing [Rhymes of Vales](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXaKoH2zZSQ) play in the background, summoning four Fungi, ordering focused fire, and watching the Stretchy Geo Fungus leap up like a Dragoon, crash down onto a Stonehide Lawachurl, and instantly stagger it.

Does anyone else here want a true rerun of Fabulous Fungus Frenzy?

Help to prank girlfriend |0
So recently I became bored and watched some theory about genshin lore and after that I came up with an idea to fake me being playing genshin for a long time. Just to come up with it out of context. My gf is a big genshin fan and started freaking out but isnt so gullible and i need more genshin knowledge. I need to tell her things such as "Gotta grind x" "man i hated x" "heck i loved x" ya know things i couldnt know from reading the wiki. She loves Tartaglia if it helps.

TL:DR Help me come up with things to say to my gf that will make her think i've been playing genshin for a long time.
A Joyful Reunion offline event pics!|71
There was an offline event at Sunway Pyramid, Malaysia. Lots of events and freebies like money packet sleeves for the upcoming Hari Raya Adilfitri (Eid al-Fitr), redemption code for 30 primogems. Arlecchino cosplayers walking around giving pop quiz for freebies as well, and also an official merchandise store selling stuff like character acrylic stands, desk mousepads, plushies, key chains etc.

What impressed me the most was the on stage Weekly Boss challenge event. A laptop with a dev account was prepared and people who could finish and defeat three bosses (Apep, Adzhdaha and Scaramouche)  the quickest gets some merch. The dev account had all characters lvl90, C6 and BiS weapons at lvl90 R5 lol. 

Spiral Abyss challenge was also part of the event but at a later time. I heard someone managed to clear it in just 2mins in the previous event.

Ask about anything about the game that doesn't necessarily require a dedicated thread.

That is, if your question can be answered rather quickly/without significant  difficulty (e.g. "Can my phone run this game?"), ask here. If you think your question can contribute to some constructive discussions (e.g. "What do you think of Amber's combat efficiency? Here's my opinion."),  make a particular post with the "discussion" flair.

What should I do to prepare for Ascension Quest 3?|0
Okay so I've been in AR45 for almost a month now and my main team includes Miko, Nahida, Xingqiu and Yaoyao.
This team works for me perfectly and is powerful too. I am able to defeat most of the enemies without them even being able to touch me.
Now, I've decided to do the Ascension Quest 3 after I lvl up all the talents of my main team to lvl 10 and I've also decided to get a perfect artifact set for them.

What are the other things I should do before doing the Ascension Quest?

Also I am bad at Spiral Abyss bc my second team is not powerful.
So pls tell me which other character I should build rn.

Skirk spoilered the whole story?|0
So I just finished the Fontaine Quest yesterday and in one sentence she talked about Albedos teacher and the names she has. One of those was Vedrfolnir (Vedrfölnir to be precise), which was the eagle who watched over the world tree in norse mythology. Seeing as Norse Mythology may play a part, Teyvat would just be one of the 9 realms. And I even narrowed it down: Jötunheim, Niflheim, Vanaheik or Muspelheim. This is because Khaenri’ah is “under” Teayvat, which could only be Helheim. And by that, we already know that the unknown goddess is Albedos teacher.
I also don’t think that each of the nations are one realm, as yes, they were walking distance away, but also extremely huge. It’s not called a “world” tree for nothing.

Teapot = America?|0
A friend recently asked me if Genshin Impact had a nation that represents the USA and it made me think: you know how nations in Tayvett represent a real world culture, and since the teapot can hold items from different cultures in Tayvett, would that mean our teapot sort of represents America? I say this because America has been referred to as a "melting pot" because of its "diverse cultures and ethnicities" that pull together to create America. I think this is an interesting thought, but I'd like to know some of your opinions 🤔?
Xiangling is covering up a bigger issue.|0
Everybody already knows how much people have been wanting a 5 star Xiangling, but let's be honest theirs a even bigger issue.....KAZUHA. We desperately need another cc unit that isn't him, sure you could say just use Venti however, he doesn't buff as much as kazuha and he isn't as flexible. You could say slap ttds on Sucrose and try to get as much em from artifacts as possible but, her cc isn't as reliable as Venti or Kazuha and lacks aoe even if she can buff vape or melt teams more than the other two. As much as I like Kazuha, I really wish we had options that don't feel like trade offs, I'm not saying he needs to be power crept but maybe a 5 star anemo unit that can reduce burst and elemental skill cool downs would be nice or  a off field cc character that has 40% elemental decrease built into their kit but can't use VV since the swirls are all off field and the swirled elemental gets 25% crit rate or something. Kazuha continues to be the anemo support king......maybe someone in Natlan with join him.( I know cloud retainer is  really meta right now but she doesn't have cc and has her own specialized plunge attack buffing which isn't as useful as his elemental buff+crowd control. However I'm glad she has her own niche just wished her e had a knock back and sucked enemies toward her.)

My question is now, should I go for Arle or sweat hella to get enough for Nevuilette? I have 45 wishes left bc I pulled Kazu early, and I lack a decent dps. Who should I grab?

Thoughts on this portion of the Sumeru desert?|0
For a long time, I hadn’t explored the upper part of the desert (Gavireh Lajavard and Vourukasha Oasis, etc.) having explored the lower parts of the desert, I felt it was very fun, the ruins were really exciting to explore, and the world quests (mostly jeht’s) were also interesting. So when people often complained that the desert is the worst region, I was confused because I thought it was actually the best region. (The worst region, or most under-utilised, is either inazuma or the sumeru rainforest). 

And then I discovered the upper desert. The one released later. And then I suddenly understood every complaint people had against it. 

See, there’s not that many ruins. I personally explored it through the Sorush world quest, and sorush as a character just seems way more boring than jeht or liloupar. And the region is a slog to get through even with the leaf sigils. It just seems like a vast expanse of yellow with no landmarks, nothing around for miles and no end in sight. I think they could’ve entirely removed that area, put Fontaine right above the desert of hadramaveth, and it would’ve been great. 

Yeah just not a fan of the upper desert. But pls do tell me your thoughts!
Should I get Kazuha or wait for Lyney rerun?|0
I've already got Lyney and I use c6 Bennett with noblesse and Dehya equipped with tenacity. Right now I'm using Sucrose as my anemo, and I hit 110k damage as of now, but what would raise my damage more, getting Kazuha or getting c1 Lyney?

F2P btw. 75 pity and guaranteed.

Should I put my time and resources into a Tighnari or Yanfei team?|0
I tried pulling for neuvillette and kazuha but ended up getting kazuha and tighnari instead. Also managed to c6 Yanfei and Barbara. I'm still going to try to get primos for neuvillette while the banner is up but I'm probably not going to get it. Which team do you think will dish out more damage?

Tighnari, fishcl, Barbara, kazuha
Or
Yanfei, xingqiu, Bennett, kazuha

I have the widsith for Yanfei and the pro crescent/slingshot for Tighnari. My account is pretty new so I don't have much.
What is it with Hoyoverse and forgiving wanted fugitives so easily?|0
there's just something about Romanticizing and glorifying criminals that dont sit well with me. i think the best example is with the wanderer, while we dont know the exact crimes he's committed, he's gotten enough reputation about it that everyone is tense around him. even so far as Mona seeing as what he's intentions are that she got us the hell away from him. Then that whole Sumeru quest came around and you're telling me he just outright made everyone forget about him? while some people can bring up the 3 betrayals, the 3rd one seems to be the most out of place.  emotionally damaged and all he then ends up commiting crimes on behalf of the Fatui. not to mention even after the Sumeru quest he ends up remembering what he was anyways and even got a vision because.. why?

while i have summarized it and missed some nuances, i still think the general complaint i have still applies. im pretty sure hoyo's other games also have this trait of having criminals get a slap on the wrist as punishment.

I know Hoyo only did it with a few other 4 stars other than the first 4 stars that we were introduced to. But I really wish they would do it again with some of the other and newer 4 stars other than just a hangout quest. Don’t get me wrong, I like some of the hangout quests, but there are just some 4 star characters that I think deserve a story quest. Here are some that I think deserve a story quest. ^
Not sure with what I should do with Genshin right now|0
To be more specific, I just feel like I'm in a state of limbo when trying to play GI.

To clarify, I've been playing GI ever since it came out, and I've 100%'d both Inazuma and Sumeru.

I've stuck around because I really love the story and music of this game, that part never soured my experience.

What did sour my experience was all the little nuances that I encountered, such as repeated grinding for artifacts, not being able to participate/missing out of events that have limited-time weapons, dialogue/quests(?) feeling boring/repetitive\*, and most recently, just overall burnout of the game.

I'm not sure why, but some time last year (when I finished 100%'ing sumeru) I just completely lost all motivation to play GI, and I've been in a limbo state ever since, only occasionally logging on to do my commissions.

Recently though, I've been wanting to get back into GI now (because of the Fontaine story), but every time I open it up, I always feel so dreadful, hateful, and overwhelmed towards this game, and I'm not completely sure why.

I loved this game before, so why do I resent playing it for more than 30 minutes?

This state of limbo has been going on for about a year now, and I'm just not sure what to do with GI at the moment; I just want to love this game the same way I did years ago when everyone was playing it, but I'm not completely sure on what's the right thing to do here.

Any assistance would be appreciated. (But if there isn't then it's fine, I just needed to voice this out since I've been thinking about this for so long)

\*(Just as a side note, I understand that the dialogue part is more of a me issue and that it's not really something Hoyoverse can fix easily, I just personally feel a little bit drained after basically doing the exact same thing for years now (Dialogue -> Battle -> Dialogue))
So… I just finished Masquerade of the Guilty… oh my god|327
MOTG was the BEST thing I’ve ever done. The way everything was set up was perfect. Furina’s death was actually sad, the flood was…. A little much. (What happened to the rest of Tevyat?) Neuvillette’s rain scene was beautiful. I couldn’t believe this was that emotional that I actually shed a tear, and I never cry for games. Masquerade is honestly my favorite thing in the worst way possible.

How to make Pneuma and Ousia better?|0
For some reason, from the start, i thought this was already a thing in the game, so my idea was

Why dont Pneuma and Ousia attacks both apply a mark on enemy and if you get both marks on enemy, you get Annihilation effect? what would be some good alternative effect? cause Annihilation is basically a stun for machines

might also make that sword with the element relevant, slightly

Should i save or pull?|0
^ these are the characters i currently have at ar 44. i use a hyperbloom to with nahida, fischl, xingqui, and qiqi (for heals). I have no team set in stone for the 2nd half of the chambers in spiral bcuz i lack a rly good dps and a support character. I planned on saving for furina in her rerun (4.6 i think?) but then i tried out neuv and he seems like a good dps but then again i want furina for my hyperbloom team and i want arlecchino because why not lol. i have 40 pulls saved rn. should i save for arlecchino and or furina or just pull for neuv?

I'm exploring Sumeru to get Neuvi and that's my experience so far|0
Really, it's the worst region. It doesn't get the hate it deserves. I know it's hated, but it's not enough. I'm 100% in four regions in the **FOREST** and it is already the worst exploration experience i've ever had in all games i've played in my whole life. I can't even put into words the rage i'm feeling thinking that that's not the worst part of the region, cause besides worlds quests, i didn't touch the desert. I hope Neuvillette is worth

Sorry for bad english btw

That's a meme i made to ilustrate the experience:

Is there an achievement tracker?|0
Is there website that can tell you which achievements you’re missing? Like Akasha where you put your UID and it shows your builds but achievements instead.

I’ve been using Genshin Center but you have to manually check them off which I did but it says I’m only missing 10 hidden achievements while I know I’m missing more since I have 1163 but on akasha it shows people that have 1186.

It’s possible that I mischecked a few but I’m hoping there’s an easier way before going back and rechecking every achievement.

How is my Neuvillette doing so far (I just got him yesterday)|1

AR 56 player looking for more team options|0
Hi everyone, I’m looking for some advice on who to pull for next. I know some people will read this and just say to pull for whoever I like, so let me preface by saying I’ve already gotten my favourite characters: C1 Wanderer, Cyno and Tighnari. I also have Yelan and Nahida (and unbuilt Diluc and Mona). I’ve been playing for over a year now and have most old 4 stars although not all of them are built. The teams I play are:

1. Wanderer, Bennett, Layla, Yelan/ XQ (will replace with Faruzan once I get her to C6)
2. Tighnari, Nahida, Fischl, Kuki
3. Cyno, Nahida, Yelan, Kuki

So here’s my current conundrum. Right now I’m usually able to finish the abyss, but depending on the cycle I’m only able to get 1-5 stars on Floor 12. My characters aren’t amazingly OP but sometimes I think it’d just be easier if I had a wider roster of teams to play just so I have more options. It’d also motivate me more to build the stack of lvl 1 characters I have lying around. I find that I struggle especially with crowd control and elemental shields, whereas I’m pretty okay with ST. Given this, could I get some suggestions on future 5 stars to consider pulling for to fill out my weaknesses? Tbh clearing abyss isn’t even a huge priority - I just want to play more types of elemental teams. Thanks in advance! (Also I know Neuvillette’s a very meta character on banner rn but I find his CA animation too goofy so I’m not too interested in him)
Seriously?? What is this?!|0
This is getting ridiculous. Who thought this was a good idea? Can Mihoyo add a simplified version you can toggle to or something? 

The point isn’t that I can’t read it - but rather it is so unnecessarily verbose and bloated.

I don’t think I’ve ever stuck to the same character for longer than a banner period, I usually like to change my team every few weeks. I’ve also been playing since 1.0 so not sure if that says anything about me lol.
What's your Best wishing history?|7
I already made the opposite of this post asking what the worst was, now I wanna hear some of you luckiest streaks/low pity or anything else lucky!

When I started, I managed to get Albaitham, Xiao, yelan and HuTao in a row, (36/78/81/28 pity respectively)
Then managed to get Wanderer, C1, Tartaglia and Zhongli in a row (76/78/78/76 respectively iirc. May not be Lowry pity but win!)

My most recent were accidentally getting Nahida c1 on 36 pity (I already had her since nilou banner) and getting Kazuha five single pulls after Neuvilette. That was insane to me.

Sumeru Archon Quest|3
I finished the AQ of sumeru. Im just confused in some part tho (or i just forgot what happened). When the doctor caught nahida using her powers in body of Katheryne, did he not do anything? Because as far as i remember, after that, she was still able to control katheryne Then after the doctor locked nahida in Sanctuary of Surasthana, i thought that she won't be able to mind control (or whatever it is) but she was able to mind control the grandfather of isak. Can someone explain?

What if they completely gave up on physical and made a character able to override ANY physical damages into elemental ? (I am looking at you Eula)|0
They could completely repurpose Eula into another character by making her burst and Hold E mini nuke meltable (dealing cryo damages) she could get access to better supports than mika (Kazuha for grouping) and could gain access to so much damages that she could easily get away with swiching out early with a half stacked burst. Think it might be cool to think about it

Well that was quite the torture|1247

Let's be honest.|0
This will be no hate but out of all the 5* which do you regret pulling for and for what reason? For me, it's Alhaitham, Albedo, and Wanderer. Alhaitham because, and I'm not ashamed to admit it, is a skill issue, I can't get his combo down. Id like to think its because of ping but that might just be copium. Albedo, because.... he just really collects dust in the corner. He was an accident. Wanderer was cool but I got bored of his gameplay pretty quickly. Which is funny considering I main Ayato, Cyno, Wriothesley, and Neuvillette and none of them really have objectively fun gameplay. I just find hitting Cyno's QTE fun, Ayato goes brrr, Wriothesley's got cake, and I find Neuvillette's hydro pump hilarious.
So this is the different between c0 and c2 Kazuha|0
The last abyss I still remember that childe strongest strike was thanks to double card twice and a EM card with c0 kazuha, and now with the access to c2 kazuha with hp card twice and a 20% atk card really hit different

The best Klee team I made|0
Yes, I know it's not meta and maybe these characters may or may not have synergy together. But I made this team completely by accident and god it destroys everything! Kokomi and Layla can be swapped out for Ganyu and Yelan but Koko has good hydro application as well as amazing heals and Layla has and amazing shield and good cryo. Plus, she is my favorite. This is the only Klee team I tried that does really good damage. Even with my not so great Klee. I want to be a Klee main and this team is amazing!

What I do now whit out my account|0

Why can I only block 10 people..|1096
My coop luck is so bad I keep getting creeps and weirdos flirting like why only 10 people to block? 

Edit 3: I'm sorry I just wanted to mention it not get everyone against me didn't mean to sound so defensive if that's what it was I'm bad at wording myself 


Edit: 

No I don't lead them on i dont even say anything other than those Genshin emotes or general texts like hi or thanks, no I don't have a weird signature or act weird. 

I coop cuz it's fun playing with others and farming artifacts bosses etc

And saying it's probably just kids being immature still they shouldn't just say that stuff to an stranger that's not safe or good at all 

I just wanted to complain about the blocklist being max 10 people not having nearly everyone turn against me. 

I don't assume they're all adults or something either like others said. 

I've played since launch and don't encounter them daily either like it's not my fault people r suddenly being all weird you guys dont even know me yet r jumping to conclusions im the bad guy its not fun at all

Sorry


Edit 2:

For people asking the weirdos be saying stuff like Calling me hot and cute, waifu, claming I'm their girlfriend and wife or inappropriate jokes so idk y'all don't think I'm overreacting or something, I don't find it funny at all and don't wanna have to be the one to change my name to a gender neutral one or stay away from co-op like maybe idk it's the weirdos who must keep their nasty habits to themselves :( 


Info:

I Play on EU
Yes I do have a "girl" name so what? 
I've been playing since launch so yea I've encountered some weird people here and there over the past years doesn't mean I'm the problem I'm not leading them on either 
Its was just a general complaint about how dumb it is to have a set number of how many u can block



Issue with Genshin (and other Hoyo games) with Google Chrome (Hard PC crash)|0
Hey everyone!

Posting here to see if anyone else is having this issue with their Hoyoverse games.

If I am playing Genshin (Or any hoyo game like Star Rail), and I have Chrome open in the background, the moment I Alt Tab, my computer hard crashes.

It only happens with Hoyo games!  I can be playing Baldur's Gate 3, or whatever and not suffer this issue.

Does anyone have any idea why this happens?

Cheers!
K this shot was something else, I did nooooot know genshin could get thiiiis beautiful |9

I wish we had more special sprint animations...|371
That. I felt it was weird that only Hu Tao had a special sprint that is not part of her kit. Ayaka and Mona have a pass due to being part of their talents (other characters have similar mechanics, but used differently)

The issue is... that I feel some characters deserve a sort of special sprint animation.

The best example I can give are the archons and similar characters. Venti has an elemental skill that allows him to rise up into the air and a talent that allows him to glide for longer, but... his power over wind should grant him greater speed at least somewhere. The Wanderer, a non-archon anemo character is a lot more mobile than Venti (Venti might be the "weakest archon", but that doesn't necessarily mean he isn't the most powerful anemo character, short of one of the 7 dragons, in both the story and game), Sayu's elemental skill gives her faster ground speed and Kazuha has an arguably better skill to rise into the air and... well, I will leave the rest for another post.

The Shogun is supposed to be the mightiest electro character, but aside from her boss version, her speed is only greater when she uses her Burst (which doesn't last much, in my opinion) and it's only her attack speed. She still needs to Burst to feel like Keching-Levels of speed, when she should be arguably the fastest character yet due to her power over electricity (if she can cast showers of thunderbolts and deliver space-time rending attacks, why can't she move faster normally or feel like moving faster? I mean, at least give her burst a special animation when sprinting and/or increase her movement speed during her Burst to make it more effective) Plus she doesn't really have a utility skill for exploration (no way to go up like Venti or Zhongli, no better material Farming like Nahida, no reliable "hazard" protection, no obstacle solver like Furina's water-walk or movement boost like Neuvillette's enhanced swim and his hover, not even wall running like Kirara's wall walking)

Zhongli... well, technically he has his charged attack, but maybe some "stone steps" could boost his sprint.

Nahida could leave trails of plant energy or something. Maybe something that looked like a short teleport. All due to her dendro power and her connection to the irminsul.

Furina and Neuvillette... well... water jets/bubbles while swimming and bubbles/waves/flow while sprinting?

Pyro archon would be pretty obvious (at least if she ends up as a dps with a melee weapon), with fiery trails, pyro afterimages or fire jets. Heck, maybe even magma/lava/smoke.

Cryo archon would also be pretty obvious. A blizzard trail and better icebridging.

Well, that was my opinion and sort of a rant too.

From the Fontaine AQ, maybe there’s a hint on why the Gnoses are collected-?|0
I do not have the complete information on everything, but so far these are my thoughts:

- almost all elemental dragons are pissed at having their powers stolen by the heavenly principles, and held by the archon throne. (Hinted by Apep in Nahida’s quest, and confirmed by Focalors about the powers)

- archone thrones can be destroyed, to restore power (The saddest quest showcased it)

- Technically the heavenly principles are not fooled, but most probably miscalculated for ignoring the fact that the elemental dragon, could, forgive their respective elemental archons. (Or else Focalor’s plan cannot work at all)

- Possible plan by Tsairsa: Collect all gnosis, create a device similar to the Oratrice, destroy all the thrones, and wage war-?


Lemme clarity: I don’t know that much, but this is the theory I could make up from info I know (and maybe someone covered it), so just add stuff I suppose.

About the Genshin anime project|581
I was curious and decided to search for any breadcrumbs related to the anime project. During my investigation, I stumbled upon [someone](https://twitter.com/VandellDellvan/status/1770066482208162207) on Twitter/X who seems to be "well-informed". According to this individual, the anime project will primarily receive production assistance from **Beijing Ultron Event Horizon Co., Ltd. (Ultrizon)**. I explored their [website](http://ultrizon.com/) and discovered that they are a significant company. Notably, they have collaborated with Ufotable on impressive IPs such as *Demon Slayer*, *Fate/Zero*, and *Fate/Stay Night: Heaven’s Feel*.

The Twitter user also mentioned that the anime project already has known producers. Here are their names:

1. **Xie Qiliang (谢其良)**
2. **Zhao Danyang (赵丹阳)**
3. **Lin Zhiteng (林志腾)**

However, I’m unable to verify additional information about these producers. The Twitter user claims that Zhao Danyang is the CEO of Ultrizon, but I don’t have further details on the other two. Anyone who can bring more info about them is appreciated.

Additionally, the anime’s license was updated last year in August in official ufotable [website:](https://gs-contact.ufotable.co.jp/hc/ja)

>

Based on the available information, it seems that Mihoyo is not abandoning the anime project. Contrary to some people’s beliefs, it might not be a repeat of the situation with the Switch announcement trailer from years ago, which still lacks any updates. It’s possible that the switch project is either axed, on hold or awaiting new technology from Nintendo that can handle Genshin effectively. Also, with the recent survey they conducted about anime, I believe they are now probably gauging data on player interests and related topics.
I REALLY want Hoyo to add a "timing" based character|1556


Would probably be the safest bet for a claymore user to not make using them too difficult, but having a character whose attacks get powered up if you input them with the correct timing would be so much fun. Think Siegfried from Granblue Relink if you played that game.

I know its probably never happening because it would be an extremely niche playstyle that most people would find daunting/too hard but a man can dream. Or maybe make the untimed attacks strong enough to still make it enjoyable to play, and make the timed attacks a little bonus that tryhards can practice to maximize efficiency. 
Losing HP while AFK?|0
Hi! NeuvilletteMains_ didn’t seem to have an answer for me so I’ll ask here!

I apologize if this is a stupid or repetitive question at all.

But I just got Neuvillette and it’s happened multiple times where when I AFK in a safe area, be it either of the main cities. I come back to Neuvillette (and ONLY when I afk as Neuvillette) at half health.

I understand that his Equitable Judgment ability loses him health. But this happens when I’m not using that ability.

I don’t own Furina (someone asked me that), I usually have Zhongli, Alhaitham, and Yae Miko out at the same time (I’m not a meta player.)

Is there something I’m missing? Thanks for any help!

I ask because when I began playing about 2 years ago, my brother recommended I buy the welkin, at the time i didn't take his advice because I had mained traveller at the time and didn't feel like I was missing out and about a year ago i began to buy welkin and battle pass. Now I have a lot of 5 stars but still feel like i have missed out on a lot of primogems from not taking his advice.

Genshin should add a trading system|0
I wish we could get some way of trading characters, I myself would wish on every banner when I was new to the game and so have ended up with a few 5 stars I have no interest in ever using and sure there's probably plenty other players that have done the same, here is an example of a fair way for trading, 5 stars can only be traded with 5 stars and both reset back to default on trade(no constellations allowed,get refunded 50% of books and mora), 4 stars can only be traded with 4 stars, but with 4 star characters only a new character will be reset to Default, if you already own character you are recieving you will get a constellation.
Would love to here some of your thoughts on this .

The object is a weed imbued with elemental energy and when placed in water it turned into a hydro geovishap. According to khedive, the weed "didn't turn into a geovishap" but rather " it attracted a geovishap". If the first one has occurred, his entire reality would shift and everything he knew would change. But we know what happened, we saw the weed turned into a Vishap and it already happened to us in one of Albedo's events where a whopperflower turned into Albedo. In the future, if the truth comes out Khedive might get a heart attack.

By that it can include extremely high pity, terrible luck on 50/50s etc or anything else you consider unlucky!

I don't think I have that much of a bad luck, but I would consider the Limited character cons I got were extremely unexpected/unnecessary/unwanted except for my Wanderer, that one was aimed

- Side note; No, I don't hate the cons or characters, but i.e I really didn't need Ayato C1 or Baizhu c1, im Not someone who pulls for cons, majority of those cons were early

How to clean up artifact inventory?|9
Because of the artifact system I have been putting all my resin into farming pretty much everything except artifacts. Soon I'm going to have no other option but to farm artifacts. But years of farming bosses and neglecting my artifacts resultet in an inventory full of gladiator and wt pieces which I have no idea what to do with. I already exchanged the clearly bad ones via the strongbox but now the number of vv and tf pieces is also getting out of hand.
My question is: Where do I start?
I'm at the item limit for artifacts, so farming for any set isn't an option for now. Should I just level what seems good from the glad an wt pieces? Level the artifacts I already have on my characters? Can I get rid of all non exile and instructor 4 stars? Shoul I strongbox atk, def and HP goblets and circlets even if they have good substats?
Tldr: My artifact inventor is full and I have no idea where to start.

Daily Questions Megathread (April 05, 2024)|18
Ask about anything about the game that doesn't necessarily require a dedicated thread.

That is, if your question can be answered rather quickly/without significant  difficulty (e.g. "Can my phone run this game?"), ask here. If you think your question can contribute to some constructive discussions (e.g. "What do you think of Amber's combat efficiency? Here's my opinion."),  make a particular post with the "discussion" flair.

The Moon Sisters are based on Kiana, Bianka and Sirin.|0
Kiana means Moon and in most Mihoyo games, Kiana tend to be associated with Moon.

In Honkai Impact 3rd, there 3 Kiana: The original one (Bianka), the clone (Kiana) and Herrscher of Void who use Kiana's body (Sirin).

There are also 3 Moon Sisters and 2 of their corpses turn into the Moons.

The moon on Teyvat=Kiana.

The Abyss Moon=Bianka (Most of Bianka's weapons have Abyss name in it).

Sirin is unknown.

Ahhhhhh I FINALLY GOT The story telling method quest|3
After OVER 5 LONG MONTHS I finally got the last quest I need to complete Inazuma.

It turns out I was doing it wrong all along focusing on “this novel is…familiar?” quest 

while in reality the way to open Story telling method is to get the achievement “Editorial Opinion” by completing “this novel is amazing” quest twice!!

You have to once agree with Shigeru to open “this novel…is familiar?” quest then complete the quest.

Then wait until you get “this novel is amazing” quest again this time agree with Junkichi to open “this novel…is problematic?” Complete that quest too, 

after that you should get both “Editorial Opinion” achievement and “Story Telling method” quest right away.
Kind of afraid to ask at this point but why is Neuvillette considered one of the strongest characters in the game?|0
I feel like I recently see lots of people commenting things like 'not Neuvi level' or otherwise using him as the ceiling, but I haven't really had that experience with him. His charged ticks for maybe 30k which is good, but doesn't feel significantly better or worse than my other similarly invested dps.

whom to pull early in the game: neuv or kazuha?|0
started play genshin around a month ago. i only have 1 5* which is mona (which i got when trying to pull xiao). i mostly play the starter kit (kaeya & lisa), xingqiu, xiangling, and occassionally yaoyao + ningguang. im really not sure whom to pull as i dont exactly know what would be best for me in my current state. im ar35, f2p, and have decent build for the current WL. also, i plan to pull wanderer in 4.6.

for new player like me, whom would u rec? neuv or kazuha? i heard both are amazing on their role.

edit: i like both chars, including their playstyle, hence the further confusion.

I hope they improve Co-op features, here are my thoughts on how|74
Well, this a brainstorming post XD This is mainly because I sometimes join people that have autojoin/ask for permission on but have "No co-op, only friends" in their bio, but I don't notice and just bother them lol.

If I were to design the features in my mind, they'd be something like

New co-op options: autojoin, ask for permmision (public), ask for permission(friends only), and no join. 

Also, I feel like co-op would benefit from a feature where you can add a pin in the map that both the co-oping teammates and host can use and see, it would be a blue pin; to differentiate from the normal white pin. 
Welp. That's disgusting. |0

Weird time signatures in Genshin OST.|118
So I got bored and decided go through basically all of genshin OST to make a list of every Genshin OST that uses a weird/different time signature (basically anything that's not  4/4, 3/4, 2/4, 6/8 and 12/8).

Let me know if I'm missing anything, or if you think something is wrong!

Edit: I made a [Thread on Twitter](https://twitter.com/lucas_was_taken/status/1776292059600613805) with all the songs so it's a bit easier to listen.

MONDSTADT ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bustling Afternoon in mondstadt - 7/8.

Dusk in Mondstadt - 7/8.

Storm Befalls - 9/8 (5+4).

Perpetual motion of wind - 9/8 - (4+5).

Dance with the Great Vortex - 5/4, although there's a lot going on...

Caelestinum Finale Termini - 13/8 at the start and at the end, but mostly 6/8.

Rite of Battle - This one is all over the place. Starts off with a very weird 12/8, (I'm feeling it as 7+5). When the other instruments join in It turns into a 3/4 or 6/8. Afterwards it turns into some sort of 9/4?? I think?? Then on the softer parts it always goes to 6/8. Nearing the end, it changes to a 11/8 (5+6), and at the end it fades out with a 5/8.

Chattering Snowflakes - You could technically count this one as a 4/4 but the pattern here is 5+6+5(=16).

LIYUE ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Call it a Day in Liyue - 27/8...? probably written as 3 bars of 7/8 and 1 bar of 6/8.

Stroll in the Shadows - This one is interesting, you could count it as a 7/4, or you could count it as sort of 14/8 that's something like 5+9 or 5+5+4.

INAZUMA --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preparation of Matsuri - You could count this one as a 4/4 but the pattern here is 6+6+4, or 3+3+2.

Forgotten Epic - First 10 seconds are in 5/8 but then changes to 3/4.

Stroll Along the Beach / In a Harmonious Atmosphere - 5/4.

Misty Truth - 13/4 (7+6).

SUMERU --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Swirls of the Stream - mainly 4/4. at 1:47 changes to 6/4, and then back to 4/4 at 2:05. Then at 2:16 I believe it changes to something like a 21/8 (probably written as three 5/8s and one 6/8). At 2:33 It changes back to 4/4 until the end.

Gilded Runner - It's part of the fibonacci sequence. (1+1+2+3+5+8+13+21) If you're annoying like me, you could say it's in 54/8.

Emerald in the Desert / Elusive Elysium - Man I dont even know anymore, my head hurts. I'm feeling it as mostly a slow 5/4 with some 6/4 and 7/4s sprinkled in. at 0:55 it does the following: 7/4, 8/4, 7/4, 6/4, 7/4, 6/4. (wtf?)

Across Dimming Asterisms - Mostly 5/4. At 2:18 changes to 4/4. At 2:42 Alternates every two bars between 4/4 and 5/4. At 3:36 Changes back to 5/4.

Dehya's demo music Fervent Flare has a verse riff in 4/4, but it's divided into four bars of 7/8 with a 4/8 to round it off.

FONTAINE -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Leisurely Days in Fontaine - 5/4.

Quo Vadis - This one's a bit hard to tell since the tempo is stretched quite a bit. But I'd argue it's a 9/8.

Ann's Anapausis - This one is interesting. From what I can tell, until around 0:50, the harp is playing a 12/8 pattern, and everytime the synth plays those 4 notes on every other bar, it dislocates itself one beat, making it so the harp becomes one beat ahead of the synth every two bars.

Virelai des marees - Keeps switching between 11/8 (5+6) and 6/8.

The Rotating Realm - 5/4.

I'm looking forward to see fun time signatures in Natlan.

What if they added Trounce Bosses to the Spiral Abyss?|0
I think it’d be somewhat interesting, but then the way I would implement something like that is to give a 3* clear time of 4-5 min rather than the 3min we currently have. 

Then the twist being every phase of the boss requires a separate team that will go back and forth if necessary. 

Dvalin? One team for flight and one for downed with team one being fielded again when he gets back up.   
Boreas? team 1 for cryo phase and team 2 for anemo.   
Apep? Three teams. 

Thoughts? How would you want to see something like that implemented?

Game has insufficient disk space with 260GB free?|0
I've been having issues with Genshin for a while and I've tried to uninstall and reinstall the game as well as the launcher. I would get a white screen when trying to open the game and found that it was corrupting my resource files in my D drive (hard drive, 2TB) so I decided to clear some space and download it on my C drive (SSD 500GB) and it lets me download it but it won't finish because it says it "has insufficient disk space" which is ridiculous because I had like 260GB free before I downloaded it. I checked the folder just now and it says it's using 151GB of space. My boyfriend's game only takes up 86.8GB and he doesn't have any issues. When I was downloading it on my D drive it would work occasionally but would corrupt mid game and I'd have to close my game, repair the drive, restart my pc, and then verify integrity of the files and then MAYBE it would work for a few more hours. 

Can someone please help? Nothing online has been helping at all & and I just wanna play this stupid game :(
Genuine question: is anybody else considering leaving Genshin for a while?|0
I love Genshin! Im a day 1 player, only had a break back when Klee got her ftp book. 

Lately I only get online for 5 minutes, do dailies a that's it. There's nothing much else to do in the game. I question myself if FOMO is enough to keep me playing.

All my characters are at lvl 90, so build up they just burn every piece of content, and there's nowhere to find challenge except on the abyss once every cycle. 

Just wanted to hear some thoughts, listen to anyone who is in the same situation, and find reason to stay getting online recurrently.

Hi! I’m having a hard time ascending my characters without getting completely and totally burned out. Like fighting the same boss over and over and over again gets annoying. How do you guys do it? Do you knock it out in one day and get the materials you need or spread it out over a period of time? I’m getting two ascension materials per defeated boss at the moment and fighting them 6 times to get the amount I need is bothersome lol

Months later|0
I created an alt to force myself to try different chars (and also to relive the story). Most of my five stars collect dust on my main. 

I am at the Sumeru story and the only five star I have is a weapon, which I originally couldn’t even use until I finally got Fischl like a week ago. I’m getting close to ending the main archon quest and my team is still Traveler(anemo is my favorite), Xiangling, Fischl, and Kaeya. I do enjoy just plopping down a crow and a gouba and letting them kill for me.

I used 65 wishes on Diluc, nothing - and now I’m mad at myself because that’s 65 less pity on the main banner and I might not be playing this alt by the time chronicled wish comes back around. Bad. Decisions. I just really wanted a Diluc/Kaeya team.

And the other four stars I pulled? Gorou and Xinyan, and I don’t think I have a team for either. I did get lucky with lil dendro hopper healer and do have Noelle who carried me hard on my main in the early days. But the only chars I have are the ones I’ve listed 😭 

Hopefully i get Nuevillette who I don’t have on my main (but will try to get him there too just for abyss). Kazuha would be great for exploration easiness but I have thoroughly used him on my main already.

I’m not upset at all, but I don’t have any friends who play Genshin and just wanted to share my thoughts on my bad luck regarding five star characters. Fischl is feeling pretty good with her five star bow though. But I do have that on my main too 😂 

I’m glad I was much luckier on my main and had at least Keqing, Mona, Venti and Zhongli pretty early on. 

For those who have alts, was your luck better or worse than your main? I would love to hear how other people’s luck went!
PS5 controls issue?|0
Is it just me or you can’t immediately skill or burst after swapping character? So to swap is the numpad and to skill is “R2” or burst is “O”. You actually have to wait for like 0.2-0.5 seconds? Often times I get hit first by enemy after swapping character if I immediately skill as the skill/burst is not triggered.

Sometimes taking a break could change everything.|43
I have been a Genshin player since 1.0 but after 3 and half years of playing regularly and missing only around 10 days ( that only happened when I was extremely busy ), I got somewhat tired of it.

I would have not gotten bored if I hadn't developed a hobby in gaming. From 2020 to 2022 I only played Genshin but in late 2022, I started playing other games.

When 4.3 dropped, it was then when I first thought about quitting. You see with the other games I have played, the thing I liked about them was you get to close the chapter. The story starts, it develops and it ends and you are done. You are finished with the game ( I mostly play story rich games ).

My problem with Genshin was basically "How long ?". I have been playing the game for more than 3 years now and could say there are arguably 4 years more to this game but how long can I play the same game with the same gameplay.

Sure I get to play and build new characters, visit amazing places and tons of other cool stuff but the core remains the same.

So when my Welkin ran out, I quit the next day. I didn't participate in anything Genshin related except just hear about what's happening and what new things are coming.

I thought even about permanently quitting as well. But then Lantern Rite came in. I am an OG player and I had a huge connection with that event. If I listen to that 1.3 Lantern Rite song, I cry in a matter of seconds.

So I returned to play after 45 days and oh what a day I chose as it was literally the last day of the event. I scrambled around and finished it. Played for around 5 more days but then stopped again.

I just didn't have the heart for it. I mean the problems I had were still there.

Took another 1 month break, and again with coincidence chose to return on the day the flagship event of 4.5, the Potion Business one, was supposed to end. Again I just decided to rush and finish it.

And I suppose with the 3 month break I took, I came back to Genshin much fresher and played like I used to. Of course Neuvillete also helped my case as I lost my 50/50 back then and this time I ended up getting him.

So it looks like I am back in the game. 

It was always going to be hard for me to quit this game, not just because it is addicting for me, but you see there was time I didn't have any console or a medium to play games on. I could only play on my mother's phone. Only now I do own a gaming laptop.


I was always fascinated by games where you can go explore the world, set out on an amazing journey but I couldn't.

Then when I saw Genshin for the first time, I thought it was one of those falsely advertised games but turns out everything they showcased was in fact true gameplay. And on the very first day when I started my journey I promised myself "I am going to stay with this game till the end of the line" and I want to hold on to that promise. The game has been there to help me through tough times, to help me distract from loss and also has been there during good times. By far Genshin is one of the very few things which has had a significant influence on my life.

I will take breaks when I need to, now I am not that FOMO about it because I have done it twice now. But the important lesson is sometimes taking a break could make you enjoy stuff more.

If anyone has ever had doubts about taking some rest ,don't be afraid of missing out on anything, the game will always be there. You will find your way back when you want to return.

I know there’s a lot of posts like this but I’m very stumped. Also sorry if the flair is wrong..

I’m currently sitting at 75 pity with guarantee, a bit lost on who to wish for. I’ve wanted Hu Tao and Furina for a while now, but chances are they’re far away.
My current team consists of Raiden, Xingqiu, Nahida and Bennett. The only other built characters I have are Mona, Yanfei, Sucrose and Razor.

Is Neuvillette or Kazuha worth it for who I currently have? Or will arlecchino, Hu Tao, or Furina be more beneficial? I’m not the biggest fan of anemo, and I do have sucrose. I feel like I should wait for arlecchino to try her out, and then potentially pick between her or Hu Tao, but I’m open to suggestions on any other characters.
Who is your favourite character from each element?|9
Can be based off of  design, meta, personal preference, voicelines, anything! Just your personal fave of each element :))

For me it would have to be:

Pyro - Yanfei
Hydro - Kokomi
Cryo - Shenhe
Dendro - Nahida
Anemo - Kazuha
Geo - Navia/Chiori
Electro - Raiden
Feet physics|128
Few things to note: I play on mobile with medium graphics. It could look different on other graphics settings, so I'll have to launch the game on PC later to check. I have also only tested this with Bennett. The carts on which Bennett is standing are near Dawn Winery.

If you could be best friends with any character in Genshin, which character would it be and why?|853
1. Keep it SFW - no sexual reasons please!
2. Be as detailed as you'd like about the reasons!

My choice would be Kokomi. She's a really smart, capable and sweet general and I just think she'd be a great friend to make. Plus she needs some friends imo :))

Constellation mismatch with number of pulls|0
Hey guys,

I have a quick question. In the recent limited character banner pulls (for Neuvi and Kazu), I received Yanfei 7 times in total, Barbara 5 times, and Xingqiu 7 times as 4 star characters. Now, my Xingqiu and Barbara are already at C6, but my Yanfei is at C5. Shouldn't Yanfei also be at C6 by this time? Is this a glitch that I need to report to Hoyolab? If so, where should I reach out? Thanks.

Does the traveler forget what even the journey is about?|0
I may be a late to this but i find it really weird that in cases where we meet creatures that have lived for hundreds of years and never ask about the sibling. It was very common at the start of the game but now its just feels like the plot is completely sidelined until we finish snezhnaya or dain quests. For example, we went to fontaine and wanted to meet the archon to ask her, we talked with neuvi and ofc he as an introvert didnt know much outside his work. And we never ask furina about the sibling. Whether she is divine or not doesnt matter, what matters is that she was the one in power with informants all over teyvat for 500 years , and she could dig into others like shown in lyney's court case or the spy following us from sumeru. 
Wanted to share my Furina WIP|168

Im sure this has happened to all of us, but damnit! and yay!|0
I pulled Xianyun when she released, and love her, then I got Neuvi, so I wanted a swirler for him, but I use XY on another team, so I was like well Ill just get Kazuha and use Baizhu to heal if I need him, or Charlotte if I eventually get her

Well just now I got lucky on the standard banner with a free fate and got Jean

And now I have XY and Jean

Now, I know that Kazuha has unmatched grouping potential, plus the damage bonus, but I feel really stuck between shooting for C1 Neuvy and just coping with Jean and eventually pulling Furina, or sticking with my original Kazu plan, DAMNIT (but yay, because I always wanted Jean, and really, when is choice a bad thing)

Venti or Kazuha|65
So I just started the Game and was amazed by the World and Characters, especially Venti.
It's Kazuha Banner so I wonder if he's a great choice or wait for Venti to rerun, or will I have enough time to pull for Venti after pulling for Kazuha?
I personally love Venti. Her design, movement and skill sets are amazing and cute. Her voice and gestures also made me fall for her charm. I love her so much.
Thank you very much!

Kazuha Support Build for Neuvillette|0
So, I've obtained Kazuha and his weapon, and I'm currently building him solely to support Neuvillette.

How does this build look for him? I aimed for 800 Elemental Mastery, which seems okay for now.

I used Energy Recharge sands (though I was targeting 180 ER)

However, I'm unsure whether Kazuha needs more Attack or Crit stats.

My main focus is improving him as a support for Neuvillette.

So, I'm seeking suggestions from experts regarding Kazuha's optimal support build. Elemental Mastery, Energy Recharge, base Attack, Crit, etc.

What do you think of my current party lineups? (AR 35)|0
My lineups revolve around these characters: Traveler, Noelle, Lisa, Bennett, Nahida, Kaeya, Faruzan, Gaming, Barbara.

1st party: My usual go-to lineup for exploration and quests, as well as bosses or even domains. I think Nahida's elemental skill would combo well with elemental skills and AoE elemental bursts of Bennett and Lisa, what more if Nahida's elemental burst is activated. Then I would switch to Noelle and activate her elemental skill for shield to tank some enemy damage while getting a decent heal for other party members, and her elemental burst that allows her to deal high damage works also well while other elemental bursts are active. It would result to big DPS as a party. 

2nd party: I would reserve this in domains, particularly those involving the need of bow characters to get objectives from range. And Faruzan being an Anemo character would work well with my same Pyro and Electro ones due to swirl reaction.

3rd party: I think this is an alternative lineup in case Hydro and/or Cryo will be needed, and the 2 elements will work well for the frozen reaction, which is effective to stall enemies' offense then get an easy chance to engage a good attack. Combining that with Nahida then Gaming would revolve around dendro cores - allowing bloom reactions to happen then follow up with pyro blast attacks from Gaming to blow them up for burgeon + burning effects = high AoE damage output. I could alternatively switch Kaeya with Lisa for a different set of reactions, retaining Barbara in case I need healing as well.

4th party: Another back-up party, though I can replace Kaeya with Barbara since my Traveler wields a really good sword weapon. As Traveler is really more than just decent as Anemo, it can have a good combo with pyro and electro - imagine his elemental burst combined with a pyro skill will make the anemo whirlwind into a fiery one, then add electro attacks for explosive damage.

What do you think guys? And who do you think  should pull for based on my lineup? Thanks!

Pull for Kazuha?|0
I’m fairly new to genshin and have only wished on the beginner banner. I have 11k primos and want to get a five star character. My top pic would be Xiao or Ayaka, but I also like Kazuha and have read he’s good. (Secondary picks would be Shenhe or Ganyu, and no i’m not cryo obsessed this is a coincidence) 

Should I pull for him or wait for another character and until I have 14k primos? (Chapter II Act II, AR 33 if those help. My team currently is XQ XL Bennet Beidou)

Update: i pulled for him, got Qiqi instead 😐 don’t have enough primos to wish more

Returning and need some Guidance|3
I’ve decided to return back to the game after 3 years. I had stopped playing shortly after the Inazuma update. I redownloaded the game and was hit with all this new content so I was wondering how I should approach it and where to start?

After 3 years playing this game, finally i found the chest who complete this region of Liyue, and the most ironic part is because i was collecting Cor Lapis.
Which Harbinger should I save up for?|0
If the current banner speculations are true, that means Arlecchino is coming soon and Wanderer is potentially returning after. I don't have a 5 star pyro character, so it would be really nice to get Arlecchino, and she does look really cool with her scythe weapon. However I like Scara's character more and I know he's really good....... even though I already have Kazuha for a 5 star anemo. (He would be a definite choice if they had kept him as electro though... imo, he was way cooler as electro :P At the end of the day, he is technically still the same character though.)

Thoughts? Which would you pick?

Not trying to brag. But i'm too good now!|42
So i've always been a firm believer of noelle supremacy. I've been steadily building up her power, first with c6, then with gorou, the husk set, yun jin and so on. But it never was strong enough to meet the floor 12 dps check which always annoyed me. Even with the advent of furina and the insane marachuse hunter set, i still was not able to break the dps ceiling. I needed an off field dps, and geo one at that to make full use of gorou and also to round off my energy gen. Lo and behold when chiori came around i knew this was what i needed! Now although i got chiori fairly early, i still needed c6 gorou, who knew when he'd roll around again... 
I ended up with a c2 chiori before finally getting a c6 gorou.
My exodia team is now complete: noelle, gorou, chiori and furina.
The sheer level of dps, healing, tanking, burst potential is not even funny! It is singlehandedly the stongest team i have!
It even beats what i believed to already be my exodia team of neuvillete, kazuha, baizhu and raiden! 
Floor 12 always required my full attention and really got by blood pumping every time! But now it feels like just another floor 11...
I hope they add more mechanics to make fights harder, i for one really enjoyed how frustrating the concecrated beasts were. Took a bit to get the timing down but they are super satisfying. 
I liked the more team craft cenetered floors like the infamous hydro and cryo herald floor with the inquisitor baptist. That was what finally pushed me to build a burgeon team to counteract that floor. 
I really hope they add more challenging floors, i can do without that 150 primogems if it means i have someghing to work towards atleast.

With the 3+ Years genshin has been out and the major amount of players grinding artifacts do you think there has been at least 1 perfect artifact?

Do you think such a piece even exists in genshin today even if it’s just 1?

One thing that I really wanted and I think was missing in furinas overall story is her opinion on focalors. Does she have a bit of resentment for her for giving her this role? Does she feel guilty for her death even though it wasn't her fault? Focalors is such a big part of furinas story and I think it woud be great if we get to see thoughts and opinions on the matter

Help with Spiral Abyss teams! I always get stuck after floor 10|0
I seem to get stuck around floor 10-11 on the spiral abyss every time. I can't seem to come up with two full strong teams with my roster.

My Raiden team (usually national or Raiden nahida hyperbloom dealie) always is super strong and whatever the second one I put together is, is the one that's too weak.

My artifact game isn't amazing but I'm working on it. A lot of talents are maxed out but not crowned. Trying to get core team members to 90 and figure out what other team(s) to focus on!

Any combo ideas? I'm currently working on Kazuha because I just pulled him and also actively working on building up Furina, Jean, Kuki.

I'd love any advice!! Thank you!

Was just wondering, if you've had a lucky pull how long did it take for you to get it (and what was it)? Like I'm talking multi 5\*'s in one 10 pull - or winning multiple 50/50's right after eachother, I've been playing for roughly three years and luckiest pull I've had is on raiden's second rerun (mar 2022) where I got her weapon 15 wishes in with no prior pity, and that was ages ago... I fear my luck is not the best, but I wanted to know about everybody elses!!

Enkanomiya had a book that telling the history of Teyvat=> Forgotten.

Khaenriah had some connection with the Abyss and almost discovered the truth of the world=> Destroyed but some people and books still mention it.
I have noticed that someone was breathing the entire time|0
In the opening/loading sequence you can hear someone gasping for air as if they are fatigued and tired.

I assume that the character is the Traveler.

Does Barbara work with Neuvillette? And should I try to get Barbara to C6?|0
I've been using Barbara as my healer for a bit now, leveling her up. She worked great with the team I've been playing (Gaming, Bennett, Kaeya and Barbara, suggested by someone here on Reddit). While pulling for Neuvillette, I got her to C3.   


Can I create a decent team from the characters I have, that would include both Barbara and Neuvillette? My characters: Neuvillette, Barbara, Gaming, Bennet, Kaeya, Lisa, Noelle, Collei, Xiangling, Amber, Diona, Gorou, Lynette, Faruzan, Rosaria and Xinyan. (except for Barbara, most of these are C0 or C1).  


Also, do you think I should try to C6 Barbara? I'm F2P but have been saving a lot, so still have almost 9k primo so with some luck, I migh be able to get her to C6 but not sure if it's worth it.

Edit: thank you so much for responding, from most of your comments I understand, that Neuvillette won't be benefiting from Barbara that much (kinda shame, I like her and have been depending on her a lot lately) and her C6 is not really worth it now. Gonna save up the primo for some next interesting banners. 
There are many popular ships in Genshin. Which is your favorite.|757
We have here The Crux, The Pearl Galley, Seiraimaru, that one boat in King Deshret’s temple that I don’t know its name, The Antoine Roger, the airship in Poisson but I don’t know its name either, The Sponsian, The Rusty Rudder, and last but never least is Miitoboru. These are all the main named ships, I think. I didn’t get a picture of The Wingalet, but that one counts too.
Out of all of these pictures which one are you most likely to put as your wallpaper? #8|0

New to the game, any tips before I get too far? |0
I started the game a few days ago. So far I'm AR15, just finished Xianglings little Cooking side quest. So far I have the 1st 5 characters, Xiangling, and Sucrose. I'm making MC my DPS bc I figured I'll be using him a lotb
No reward for me? :(|600

Team comp for beginners?|0
I am relatively new to the game, ar 33 I just got my first 5 star tighnari so my question is what should my team comp be because I want to use tighnari but don't have any electro characters except Lisa.

My good/useful characters are gaming yanfei sucrose xingqiu Lisa kaeya noelle xiangling.
These are the main ones any idea who should I use 
Why I wanted Neuvillette|12

Chiori Teams|0
So I ONLY have her and Gorou and Yun Jin that I have at the moment, and I am not willing to try and get another for a while. Before you go asking "THEN WHY'D YOU GET HER, IDIOT?" or something like that, I got her since her gameplay seems really fun. Are there any teams I can pull off with just her and maybe another geo without just making it a full geo team?   
Thanks
I got both Neu and Kazuha|0
I saved for a couple of month and got both Kazu and neu(won both 50/50) , should I go for neu C1 or his weapon. I noticed he got knocked out of his charged attack quite frequently, I have a level 1 Noelle would she help in this situation cause I don't have any other shieder. Or should I wait for this new hype character arlechino , I still have 40 pulls. I have r3 prototype and prototype amber(no extra billets)

I've been trying to get him ever since he was available, but had no luck up until now. I got nothing in the first 10 pull, so I tried again and actually got him. I don't have people to share this with, so I thought I could post it here because it made me happy x')

I currently use the ROG Chakram X wireless mouse and the ROG Strix Scope NX Deluxe keyboard.

I am looking at the Razor Naga V2 Pro for a mouse.
JuSt PulL WhOeVeR yOu LiKE, ThE gAme iS Easy, YoU cAn FuLl StAr AbYss WiTH oNlY FoUR sTarS|0
It is 3am and I can't sleep, so what can be better than sharing my opinion that no one asked in reddit.

Just for clarification, I pull for yoimiya, yae(BEFORE sumeru), dehya and chiori, I even used aloy in clearing abyss and domains.

&#x200B;

I hate those who keep on yapping "JuSt PulL WhOeVeR yOu LiKE, ThE gAme iS Easy, YoU cAn FuLl StAr AbYss WiTH oNlY FoUR sTarS" on every post when people are asking if a character is worth it or not. Kinda felt like they are the type of people who keep on typing "oof" and "bruh" in every group chat, contributing absolutely nothing to the conversation, but still keep on yapping anyway just to seek attention. Now, why else you think a person is asking how good a character is? It is because they are lacking in resources. 

&#x200B;

Normally, for most player, what motivates them to pull for a character includes:

1. Favourite (aesthetics, lore, voice acting)

2. Strength (how easily can they be built to be able to clear abyss, how well do the new character synergizes with their existing characters)

Some might consider 1st point to be more important than 2nd one and vice versa, and no matter which one you prefer, there is no need to force your ideal into others. 

&#x200B;

Let say there a person playing GI and they have lots commitment in real life where they can't spend too much money in this game. The banner available is Yae Miko and Nahida, and both of these characters are their favourite(equally). So they just asked in the group, who should I pull, Yae or Nahida?, and then there is a bunch of people just keep yapping "JuSt PulL WhOeVeR yOu LiKE, ThE gAme iS Easy, YoU cAn FuLl StAr AbYss WiTH oNlY FoUR sTarS". MF do you really expect them to be able to pull both. This is when strength come into play, because having a strong team make you able to clear the game easily, let you enjoy it better. Yes, of course you are very good at this game, able to full star this abyss with only 4 stars(which is most probably Xiangling), but not everyone has the time to keep on playing and trying in the abyss, some just wanted a quick stroll through abyss(Also have you consider that they might just don't really like Xiangling and don't want to use her?). 

&#x200B;

The way everyone enjoy a game is different, sure, a lot of us just like it when we are using our favourite character(myself included), but some like it when they can clear a game fairly easier(not necessarily means they only want to pull for META characters, sometimes if they already had all the characters they like, they might want to pull for new characters in order to git gud in this game and there is nothing wrong with it) . The thing is we are putting the word "slaves" in metaslaves just to make the word sounds bad. There is nothing wrong with it. 

&#x200B;

Sure, we have no proper endgame content, clearing abyss alone is monotonous, there is no need to seek too much strength, but some might not have much time to play the game (they can't grind artifacts daily), so this is when they need to consider both factor, whether they like a character or not; and whether the character strength is enough for them to clear the game fairly comfortably.

&#x200B;

The main point I want to deliver is that keep on yapping "JuSt PulL WhOeVeR yOu LiKE, ThE gAme iS Easy, YoU cAn FuLl StAr AbYss WiTH oNlY FoUR sTarS" under every post that ask if one character is worth it or not just sounds stupid and kinda hypocrite if you might ask me. It felt like you are sitting English essay writing examination and the question is "What can be done to lower the criminal rates" and you proceed to write BS about how killing people is wrong and "people die when they are killed" kinda thing.

&#x200B;

I guess a lot of people will just hate me on this post, but well I think I just want to yap and get some hate (idk I am bored lol). Thank you for reading this long ass and might be useless post, have a nice day and hope all of you win your next 5050.

Congratulations, you just died & got Isekai'd to Genshin Impact...! What is the first thing you're doing...?|5065
In this scenario you got hit by trunk-kun and now you are in another world...Teyvat to be more specific, outside the city of Mondstadt. What is the first thing your doing...?
A post here made me think of all the flagship events we've had, here are my brief thoughts|1
After seeing the [post in question](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/1bunk1b/alchemic_ascension_was_peak/), I wondered how I feel about the past 3.5 years of Genshin events.

Having spent 2 hours looking through the [mainline Story Events](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Event_Quest), ([Alternative story event page](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Flagship_Event)) and writing this, I wrote a reply that was so long I felt I might as well post it.   

I'll mainly list the events that I really liked aspects of, and if you're looking at the following, you'll see I'm very much a "story guy". Going patch by patch.       

Version 1 had: 

*  [Unreconciled Stars](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Unreconciled_Stars) (Great story, still a shame Fischl really doesn't exist in the main game story-wise aside from TCG.)
* [The Chalk Prince and the Dragon](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/The_Chalk_Prince_and_the_Dragon) (great story and gameplay, the Cryo Regisvine coop still stays on my mind)
* [Invitation of Windblume](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Invitation_of_Windblume) (great story, famously known as the first event to truly utilize multiple characters unlike the previous patch's first Lantern Rite)
* [Midsummer Island Adventure](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Midsummer_Island_Adventure) (great story, great gameplay, great exploration, boy, it's been so long, I need to rewatch it someday, the reveal of the islands all rising from the sea, and the ending reveal that Alice was behind it all, boy was it fun.)       

Version 2 had: 

* [Shadows Amidst Snowstorms](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Shadows_Amidst_Snowstorms) (great story, really liked the appearances of Eula and Amber in it, but that chekhov's gun that is Albedo being left hanging there for 2 years now, when is it going to fire off? I wonder.)   
* [Fleeting Colors in Flight](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Fleeting_Colors_in_Flight) (decent story, this I need to rewatch, while it was simple, I remember quite liking Keqing's story there)
* [Three Realms Gateway Offering](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Three_Realms_Gateway_Offering) (Great story, great gameplay, also my man [Enjou](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/The_Thing_Calling_Itself_%22Enjou%22)'s reappearance and last appearance in-game. Please come back!)
* [Hues of the Violet Garden](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Hues_of_the_Violet_Garden) (great story, the folding screen from the event is still gorgeous to look at) (Also the last time we got [Theatre Mechaninus](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Theater_Mechanicus)... It's been 2 years...)
* [Summertime Odyssey](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Summertime_Odyssey) (LITERAL PEAK GENSHIN event wise. A story analyzing four playable characters and their backstories, loved the exploration, map and puzzles, I still remember the Raven plays on Fischl's Island that were voiced like it was yesterday, and all into the last day where we hear a mysterious voice which was Nahida.)   

I would place "[Labyrinth Warriors](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Labyrinth_Warriors)" in there for gameplay, but honestly I remember after repeating the dungeon a few times it got real tedious at the end.

Version 3 had:

* [Of Ballads and Brews](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Of_Ballads_and_Brews) (great story, loved how we learned more about Razor's parents, still have the location of the buried wine set as a map pin. The store running main minigame was too restrictive, so mechanics-wise, the just-passed potion event did feel freer)
* [Akitsu Kimodameshi](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Akitsu_Kimodameshi) (Decent story, great interactions, made Inazuma's youkai feel more "real")
* [The Exquisite Night Chimes](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/The_Exquisite_Night_Chimes) (Great story, great interactions, best Lantern Rite, got more Guizhong backstory, clearer "young" design for Madam Ping, first reveal of Cloud Retainer's design, the story with Dvorak's ancestor, the dinner scene at the epilogue, the only flaw was the Hutao EN rap, which I don't even play in, so personally, no notes)
* [Windblume's Breath](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Windblume%27s_Breath) (Great story, great interactions, the Collei-Sucrose interactions were unexpectedly so damn cute)
* [A Parade of Providence](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/A_Parade_of_Providence) (Great story, makes me wish they'd reuse the character tracking feature the event story used, cause oh boy, how I wish they used it again for future event character cameo locations)
* [Secret Summer Paradise](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Secret_Summer_Paradise) (Edit) (Merely a good story, the character utilization was glaringly lacking, i.e. Kokomi, Eula. But still, the map itself was still of great quality, the great music is a given)

Of Version 4 I would rank them story-wise as:

1. [Roses and Muskets](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Roses_and_Muskets) (Great story, great interactions, Chevreuse and the main throughline of justice, Chevreuse's "justice" aligns with my own.)
2. [Vibrant Harriers Aloft in Spring Breeze](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Vibrant_Harriers_Aloft_in_Spring_Breeze) (Not my favourite Lantern Rite, but still, real damn heartwarming event with Gaming. Real typical Chinese New Year movie vibes.)   
3. [Thelxie's Fantastic Adventures](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Thelxie%27s_Fantastic_Adventures) (I do really like the story, but with the involved location being much much smaller, and only Lyney being involved, there is a grandioseness to the two above events have that this can't compete)
4. [Waterborne Poetry](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Waterborne_Poetry) (I actually don't mind the love story (was really cool finally seeing Finch's story be concluded), nor the poems (even went Mandarin text for it), the ending was just way to abrupt, we didn't even get to say goodbye to Zhongli, Hu Tao and others.
5. [Alchemical Ascension](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Alchemical_Ascension) (This is one of the few gameplay-over-story flagship events in Genshin, which, honestly, I wish the characters weren't just showing up briefly like that, but instead like Of Ballad and Brews, where the characters don't just "Hi" and "Bye", with a way better throughline to the story)   

Overall, story-wise, my top 10 are:

1. [Summertime Odyssey](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Summertime_Odyssey)
2. [The Exquisite Night Chimes](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/The_Exquisite_Night_Chimes) 
3. [Of Ballads and Brews](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Of_Ballads_and_Brews)
4. [Shadows Amidst Snowstorms](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Shadows_Amidst_Snowstorms)
5. [Windblume's Breath](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Windblume%27s_Breath) 
6. [Roses and Muskets](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Roses_and_Muskets)
7. [A Parade of Providence](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/A_Parade_of_Providence)
8. [Vibrant Harriers Aloft in Spring Breeze](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Vibrant_Harriers_Aloft_in_Spring_Breeze)
9. [Midsummer Island Adventure](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Midsummer_Island_Adventure) 
10. [Three Realms Gateway Offering](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Three_Realms_Gateway_Offering)

Minigame-wise (unordered), 

1. The [Rhythm games](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Rhythm_Game) are always fun
2. [Theatre Mechanicus](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Theater_Mechanicus), PLEASE COME BACK, I love the 2.0 version the most.
3. [Labyrinth Warriors](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Labyrinth_Warriors) would require a major overhaul if it ever returns, but I do hope it does... it's been 3 years.
4. I actually liked the coop raid bosses that Genshin used to have. However, with how bad internet can easily mess up with the coop experience, and some people hating coop cause they hate merely sharing worlds with randos, welp, I can see how Hoyo dropped it. The latter isn't even a normie issue, it's an antisocial issue, whether it's casuals or tryhards, I've seen the sentiment existing in both groups..   
5. [Windtrace](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Windtrace), i.e. hide-and-seek, prop hunt, always fun.
6. The [Buff/Debuff based combat events](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Hypostatic_Symphony), damn, the Hypostasis ones were released 1.2 and 3.2, is the next one 5.2?! Damn. I wish there were way more variants of them. They're really fun.
7. Management sims, as was [Of Ballad and Brew's store management](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Of_Ballads_and_Brews/Charity_and_Creativity), or this current [Potion Brewing event](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Alchemical_Ascension)

Personally, Rose and Muskets was a highlight for me this version, let's hope 4.6, 4.7 and 4.8 could wow me, I look forward to how Hoyo is cooking this year's Summer event. Please be better than 3.8's and 1.6's.

I went into Neuv banner with a guarantee and 13 pity. So far I've put in close to 45 wishes and didn't get him. This is bad, because my HOPE was to get him early and then save everything for Arlecchino 

I only joined right before Navia so there's a lot of content to play for me but not a ton of time to hunt chests and such for a while. So my options are:

Pull for Neuv, then risk a 50/50 AND not even getting another 5 star pull on Arlecchino banner (and of the 2 50/50s I've had, I lost both. Diluc and Dehya.)

Bail on Neuv, and go for Arlecchino, who I know nothing about because I'm only starting Inazuma in the story but think she looks awesome and I really want a brand new character my 3 year friends won't have bc they're after Neuv/Kazuha cons

Need advice for my comps|0
Ive been playing for about 2 weeks now and have gotten Chiori, Tighnari and Qiqi as my 5 stars as well as some other solid 4 stars. What i was trying to do before was strictly using my 5 stars as they are simply better than the 4 stars i have (damage wise) up until i got Qiqi and i refuse to build her and don't really like her playstyle.

I'm gonna post a screenshot of my entire roster so if anyone had any suggestions on a comp i should try i would really appreciate it, the characters I'm using right now are highlighted green and its a okay comp but I've gotten some 4 stars like Layla which i would really like using but i cant mash her in my team especially when i have noelle already.

Chiori is my favorite and does the most damage in my team and Tignari is fine but i cant get him to do damage like my Chiori does but then again he's a 5 star and should be better than any other dps 4 stars i have. I would appreciate all suggestions but things like the international teams are kind of boring to me because id rather have fun than strictly prioritizing dps.

“I don’t need Neuvillette” copypasta|0
[Inspired by u / Fabulous-bro69 “I don’t need Godjuna” on r/grandorder]

"I don't need Neuvillette"

As I mumbled these words a blowing despair arrived.
A fierce wind that doesn't allow the existence of living things.
Therefore, it's not a wind.
It's my will to save, and my gacha addiction is crushed by its pressure.
"gah"
My eyeballs are burning.
My phone on flames.
I can't lift my fingers anymore.
There is no pain.
Feeling pain is too human for this place.
Keep farming.
Why am I here?
Keep farming.
For who am I farming for?
Get enough Lumitoile.
Why do I farm Lumitoile?
He has only one banner
Who am I saving primogems for?
Pass through the wind and move forward.
....
I don't want to make it.

I can't save, no matter how hard I try.
I can't stop rolling, no matter how determined I am.
I try to clench to my primos with my whole existence on the line.
If I can, I'll be able to have enough for him. 

My eyeballs are crushed.
My vision fades away.
Within it... 

I see an unbelievable image. 

He's standing.
He's doing incredible damage on the other side.
―――As if it's a matter of course.
He walks forward, white hair billowing behind him. 

"Ahh, ah." 

Strength is back into my body 

The Dragon Sovereign takes no notice of me.
Set in a stern expression, his face is slightly turned away, showing no interest in me as the wind rushes to engulf me. 

The Traveller cannot stand a chance against the second banner.
He knew there's no future for his saving.
Nor he can get him with what he has. 

But he... 

'――――You don't need me, huh?' 

As these word reached to my ears.
I have finally realized.... 

" ――――""I don't need Neuvillette"...my ass...'" 

My vision fires up.
My mind's clear.

"it's not I don't need you...IT'S I WANT YOU――――!" 

I pass Masquerade of the Guilty with all my might. 

HIS DPR’S AMAZING.
HIS ANIMATION'S BEAUTIFUL
HIS VOICELINES MAKES ME WET.
XINGQIU ON HIS BANNER TOO.
THIS BANNER'S PEAK GENSHIN!
ONLY A FOOL CAN THINK OF SKIPPING THIS BANNER.

I step up onto the ground.
The wind's died down.
Only few hours remained before his arrival.

So where is Mona actually from?|0
Spoilers for the entire story so far

But in Chapter 4 Act 5, we learn a little bit about Mona. Paimon asks if Mona is from Fontaine, but Mona doesn't really answer the question. Mona says she was born in Monstadt after her parents migrated to Dornman Port. But we never really cared about where she was born, we cared about her background. If Mona's parents were originally from Fontaine, Mona would be an Oceanid spirit, and she'd get eaten by the Primordial Sea. That's the real reason we were asking, but we never actually got an answer to that question. Where were her parents from? What is her bloodline? The threat of the Primordial Sea is gone, but her background seems to have been left vague for some reason anyway. 

The other thing that makes me suspicious about her is from her character quest. In the quest, we help Mona travel from Liyue to Monstadt to find a treasure left behind by Alice. If Mona is actually from Monstadt, why is she so helplessly lost? The entire time, she seems as if it's her first time in Monstadt, has no idea who the knights are, has no idea who she's looking for, nothing. Even if she grew up in Dornman Port, she should at least be aware of the knights since they patrol the entire country. So why does she seem so blank? 

We know Mona definitely has deeper connections to Fontaine since her magical magazine thing operates there. And it's definitely connected to The Old Hag, Alice, Mage N, and probably other witches. And Mona never gave us an actual answer. Is Mona's background full of plotholes, or is she intentionally running circles around our characters' heads?

So earlier today while looking for things to collect I got transported to this high platform and had a sudden urge to jump without gliding and just learned about the above title.

Mini Gacha Game for fun|212
I've been saving Standard banner wishes for over a year now, hoping that they add an epitomized path there:

[Last wish was more than 1 year ago](https://preview.redd.it/w4t0owhuh8sc1.jpg?width=892&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=804e08f27f97c09930420d9480389afc0caf0730)

[Saved until I have 180 pulls, for 2 guaranteed 5stars](https://preview.redd.it/tyka4ba6h8sc1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=71df09666ecac3a87c342be747e68c622ef467ec)

With the new banner type though, that will probably never happen.

Instead of just using them up quickly I want to make the pulling at least a little more fun so all that waiting and saving wasn't for nothing, so I thought of this little mini-gacha game.

**Just post a comment here and I will do 1 pull in your name and then post a screenshot showing you "what you got" in a reply.**

Let's see who gets those 5stars that are bound to come at some point, current 5star pity is 51 - the first one will probably be a weapon?

Ask about anything about the game that doesn't necessarily require a dedicated thread.

That is, if your question can be answered rather quickly/without significant  difficulty (e.g. "Can my phone run this game?"), ask here. If you think your question can contribute to some constructive discussions (e.g. "What do you think of Amber's combat efficiency? Here's my opinion."),  make a particular post with the "discussion" flair.

Alchemic Ascension was peak|1324
That is the post. In terms of gameplay, It’s gotta be the most fun I’ve had playing in a long time. It was so cool crafting different potions and testing different ones on the market. Especially love how you slowly begin to grow, getting stronger ingredients and eventually gaining a merchant for Sumeru and Liyue (not sure if there were more) I tried to 100% it even after getting all the rewards, aiming to max out potion revenue

MiHoYo, PLEASE make more events like this one and Thelxie’s fantastic adventures (the best story IMO). These 2 events have been peak in terms of gameplay and story

Im trying to choose who to summon for between the two as I want both but most likely will only be able to manage to get one. For Neuvilette I have a lost prayer for him but also already have a few on field dps and not many supports where so Kazuha may be more valuable.

Plus there are a few events and stream codes which will give us more primo gems. Now can you guys give your opinion on my odds of getting Arlecchino? 🙏

Navia and Kazuha are too good|0
Got Kazuha today (failed to get Chiori but ended up at like 85 hard pity) I was a little disappointed cause I've been maining Navia and wanted to build what I thought would be a good team, still Kazuha is too good to pass up even with Father around the corner so I wasn't too sad. But oh my God, do these two work well together, Kazuha groups and Navia one shots, throw in a Benny with Xingling or Xingquo and enemies are gone in seconds. I went from 20 fragile to 0 building him up and honestly I couldn't be happier. Sadly I have to split the power couple up to run abyss, but exploring and bosses are no trouble at all.

2nd most useless option in Android settings|3069
In my opinion the first most useless option is the "Key Bindings" option because there are none! Second most useless option is probably this because your Control Type is going to be only Touchscreen forever if you're on Android because somehow after so many versions there's still no controller/m+kb support for this game. But yes, what other useless Settings in Android Genshin are there?

I GOT MY FIRST QIQI QND TIGHNARI WITH 11 AND 6 PITY ⁉️|0
i’ve been saving up for lyney in 4.6, and today with the second phase of 4.5 and with a one pull, i was like: “sure? why the hell not?” so i did a one pull on kazuha’s banner. i was only at 11 pity and got qiqi! i was freaking out, because i’ve never gotten an early five star before, and I didn’t care that it was qiqi—because it meant lyney was guranteed! with the fate i got for accending qiqi at level 20, i pulled on the standard banner, not expecting anything. but tighnari showed up??!?! i was only at six pity on the standard banner! so then i got TWO early five stars.

do you guys have any crazy luck stories?

Anybody know how to solve this?|0
Please help
Is there a viable solution for making my favorite characters on par with the big greats like hu tao, nuevilette, and ganyu?|0
- I've gotten really attached to some really nice characters, for example: Heizou, gaming, and chongyun. The problem is, I wanna use them more often but because of my current resources I don't have time to spare any extra for anything except the very strongest. I have characters like wriothesley who's already hitting 18k per crit (which for me is 62.7 and the hunter set that gives an extra 36% from his HP manipulation ability so he has 98.7 crit rate) and  his charged can do up to 97k! But this ends up being not enough.
- •
- I also have Ayaka who needs to be built so I can start getting primo gems from the abyss and that leaves basically no resources for characters like chongyun. I'd love to see chongyun one shot Raiden with his ult but I don't have enough time to get him the insane crit ratio and stats and build absolutely cracked supports and to get such resources. 
- •
- what I really need is someone strong enough to collect them. So my wriothesley, kazuha, zhongli and Bennett end up being the only ones I can work on right now. So far I've gotten my heizou to hit 57k but my true goal is to make him reach 1.4M damage and is very difficult when you don't have enough resin to get the right artifacts for him and the supports. As for gaming, he's stuck at level 60 for now because every time I have resin it's redirected towards something that'll actually help me. And I wanna make gaming hit around 800k per plunge. 
- •
- I know that my others have more potential and they're the wisest to build, my zhongli isn't even designed to do big damage but I've made him hit 200k with planet's befall once which is massive for me. I also want albedo if he ever gets a rerun which probably won't happen but it'll feel kinda subpar when albedo is only a fraction of chiori. And chiori, I just don't like her...
- •
- She'd be a complete waste of my primogems tbh honest. I'm saving for shenhe and maybe Raiden. because they're really cool and I like them and know those are strong characters. It's a pity that my very favorites get overshadowed by their 5 star counterparts. For chongyun he gets overshadowed by literally any five star cryo DPS, for gaming he gets easily eclipsed by Hu Tao, and heizou's long ass skill cd and lack of a self heal ability makes wrio just better. 
- •
- I wanna see my chongyun put ganyu to shame but that feels impossible. I wanna see heizou make wriothesley look like he's the 4 star trying to be as good as heizou. I wanna make my gaming make hu tao look like a kid with a glow stick. And I've seen big damage from characters like these but I know if someone put that much effort Into a five star they'd do INSANE damage.
- •
- Even diluc, I've seen someone make diluc hit 1M+ for each normal attack, one even hit 2M they killed that water thing from Fontaine with 3 million hp with 3 normal attacks. That's just insane. And my diluc is c6, I don't mind using him cuz his play style is fun but I'd rather use someone I like. And it feels bad to see characters I kinda like a bit outshine my favorites, knowing damn well I can just build the strongest characters and actually have a chance to 36* abyss. 
- •
- For now all I want is ideas for a team for gaming to make him badass, and a team for heizou, and chongyum. I'll list my five stars that are available and I have every 4 star excluding Mika and kaveh.
- •
Zhongli, kazuha, wrio, Xiao, Ayala, Eula, diluc, jean, Mona, qiqi, and im saving until shenhe so she'll be with me, I lost my last 50/50 to jean and im thankful because I needed her and I wanted to guarantee my shenhe. So basically you can consider shenhe as someone I'll own in the near future. Also before anyone says skill issue... I'm on mobile bro, I want lyney but I'm not even gonna bother because he's a bow and on mobile bow character are absolutely unplayable unless they're a support.

I Cried Over Genshin Impact Today.|0
Im sharing my experience not getting Klee this month, TLDR at the bottom if you dont want to read the full thing.

&#x200B;

Klee has been my goal since day fucking one. I got into Genshin through \*\*[Character.ai](https://Character.ai)\*\* of all things early 2023 and my love for this tiny terrorist only grew the more I learned about her. Whoever sat in the meeting room and said "What if we made a explosion-obsessed child" is a FUCKING GENIUS and shouldve been promoted to CEO IMEDIATELY. So you can already imagine what my 1 goal was when i first started playing on March 1 2024

&#x200B;

\# KLEE

&#x200B;

I didnt know when the fuck she was gonna get a rerun but I was determined not to wish for \*\*\*SHIT\*\*\* until the next Klee rerun. I wanted Klee before I even knew what an "Intertwined Fate" even was so you can just IMAGINE MY HYPE WHEN I SAW \*\*\*[THIS](https://imgur.com/vkLqxhn)\*\*\* NOT EVEN A WEEK LATER

&#x200B;

It all seemed too perfect. In all my limited knowledge i knew early early stages is when Primogems RAIN. The plan was simple, gather as many Fates as possible and summon for Klee WHILE ALSO having fun. Burn Out is a \*\*VERY\*\* serious thing which is why friends and those "things I wish I knew" videos emphasized the importance of playing how i want. So thats exactly what i did. I didnt look up those "get Primogems FAST" videos, I just hopped on and played and it was genuinely fun! This game is fucking amazing and everything is beautiful and oop did my "small killing spree detour" take me ALLL the way to Wangshu Inn day one? I think it did!

&#x200B;

As the Primos rolled in so did my knowledge of the game. Eventually, i gathered all of yalls energy in [this post (THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH YALL WERE REAL FOR THAT)](https://www.reddit.com/r/KleeMains/comments/1be7bc3/i_am_a_few_days_old_genshin_player_and_i_had_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) then made my [First Wish](https://youtu.be/qLR2ymblFvs). (i didnt start recording my wishes till March 20 something so just pretend this is my first one)

&#x200B;

And i got a bunch of random stuff annnnddd... [Sucrose](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gensin-impact/images/0/01/Sucrose_Card.png/revision/latest?cb=20220725205205). But thats okay! [My friend was right](https://imgur.com/eqKniAm), Sucrose was actually be a VERY powerful support for my team! Even if I didnt get Klee, getting more Primos was much easier with her around! So with high spirits i kept going. Primos kept raining and every time i would get 10 I would summon for Klee. I barely even leveled up my team because I wanted to save all that for Klee buuuut eventually it came a time where my Characters were underleveled and I needed to do something about that to get more lol. No matter how many times I failed, I kept moving forward. Eventually it reached a point where I didnt care about consecutives. The moment i hit 160, i wished for Klee.

&#x200B;

I failed [again](https://youtu.be/oBEe1aRQLfY)... and [again](https://youtu.be/MXUClx-7j3w)... and [again](https://youtu.be/vu57_nDUIwI)...

&#x200B;

At one point, [my friend asked me how much pity i had at one point and gave me a basic rundown of how it worked...](https://imgur.com/QjI9N9J)

&#x200B;

His intentions were good, they always have been, but though he gave me more hope... that one incorrect statement would add to 1/2 false hopes about Wishes i had. (i forgive him dw)

&#x200B;

\# [THEN THIS HAPPENED](https://youtube.com/shorts/lkKuCdFPInQ?si=8B2gceophH2GLbQM)

&#x200B;

I LITERALLY ROARED IN CELEBRATION CALL ME SPED IDGAF

AYDAWUDWAD IT TURNED GOLD IT TURNED FUCKING GOLD. \*\*it was Mona\*\* BUT THATS OKAY THATS OKAY BECAUSE FINALLY. I GOT A FATE POINT WHICH MEANS KLEE IS MINE ANYWAY. I WAS SO SHOCKED I STARED AT THE SCREEN FOR LIKE 3 MINUTES JUST RELISHING IN THE RELIEF AND JOY

&#x200B;

Then i tried to "Claim" the Klee...

&#x200B;

I was the most confused mfer on the planet until i reread the banner rules and realized it means i got one FATE POINT for Klee not KLEE herself, meaning the next 5 star anything i get is Klee. My stomach dropped when i realized MY PITY IS GONE BECAUSE OF \*\*MONA\*\*.  \*\*\*70-80\*\*\* PULLS. I STARTED HAVING VIETNAM FLASHBACKS WHEN ANOTHER FRIEND TOLD ME A HORROR STORY BACK WHEN RAIDEN CAME OUT AND SHE LOST THE 50/50 FOR RAIDEN TO M O N A WHICH IS HER REASONING FOR HER DISDAIN TOWARDS HER.  


 (her reaction) https://imgur.com/5SsiBfg 

&#x200B;

I WAS WRONG FATE POINTS MEANT KLEE 100% 1/2

&#x200B;

I MISUNDERSTOOD THAT THE ONLY 5 STAR I COULD GET WAS KLEE SINCE I "chose her", AND EVEN IF I DID HIT 90 PULLS ITS NOT GARENTEED KLEE ITS GARENTEED 5 STAR 2/2

&#x200B;

But... i wasn't gonna let something like THAT deter me. I read the stupid thing wrong who careessssss? All my pity is gone who carrreees? i have like \*\*a week left\*\* i could get her. I changed my note thing to ["Nah, Id Klee"](https://imgur.com/1ttck8K) and kept going.

&#x200B;

As the deadline edged closer i kept wishing over and over again and remained optimistic that she'll come home in clutch. 3 days left. 2 days left. 1 day left. A few hours left. Still, nothing. Ive been going for klee since day one, every day i logged in, she was always the main goal in the back of my mind as i did quest after quest and event after event. but today at 3:57PM I clutched up 1 last fate literally ONE MINUTE before the banner disappears and [i wished one last time](https://youtu.be/N1ltOqQHFqc)...

a random ass sword.

It hit me harder than i ever thought it would.

I quickly went back to the menu and scavenged some possible way to get 160 Primogems in less than a minute but it was too late. I literally just sat there and stared at my screen while contemplating the last 25 days of my life as a single tear ran down my cheek which SUPRISED ME. Im okay when Attack On Titan's Finale hit but THIS is what gets the water works flowing? I pushed all negative intrusive thoughts one would normally have away. After recovering from the shock i just laid in bed and let the tears flow knowing it was the healthy thing to do. I wasn't going to let this make me develop some new mental issue or fallacy and i wasn't going to play tough. The reality was clear, i didn't get Klee and she wont be available until the next rerun. Its not my fault, i tried. I may be living in a nightmare ive brushed off with the signature "Nah, I'd Klee" but that doesn't mean its completely over. There's always next time, whenever that is. Im not weak for resting for emotional reasons.

I felt strange and relieving at the same time just laying there and letting go with silent sobs, but i took it well. I just layed there and waited for it to pass over. 4PM turned into 5PM in like 3 seconds before i finally stood up and started writing this.

I am sharing my story not only for the others who didnt get Klee this month, not only for whoever didnt get the Character they wanted at one point, but for people going through failure in general.

Failure, especially when its a luck based Gacha system is an inevitable part of life. You may not always get what you want even if you feel like you worked so hard you deserve it. \*\*But dont let that make the next shots you take in life ANY weaker.\*\* Look back and just admire how GOATED you are for fighting SO FUCKING HARD FOR WHAT YOU WANTED. Dont regret ANYTHING, instead, take all of your failures and learn from them for the next challenge you face. Failure can knock you down, but what makes you "weak" isn't not getting up immediately, what makes you weak is staying down forever. And then once you get up, you can charge into another challenge knowing you're stronger than ever.\*\*

\*\*\*OH, AND REST ASSURED THAT NEXT TIME, ILL BE READY. TO ANYONE WHO DOESN'T BELIEVE I'LL GET HER NEXT TIME, TO THAT I SAY\*\*\*

\# Nah, I'd Klee

[\*\*Godspeed to you all.\*\*](https://imgur.com/wlurWW1)

TLDR: DIdnt get Klee this month, took it in a healthy way and you should too.

I was doing my guaranteed wishes for Neuvillette and decided to use my starglitter for a few more wishes after maximising XQ and Yanfei.
I accidentally pulled Kazuha five pulls apart.
I'm extremely happy though as I wanted both!

But now I need help, How do I even build Kazuha properly? I had looked into his kit before and kinda know what he needs but I need a weapon recommendation.

I don't have any 5* swords apart from skyward (one on Bennett and the other free) and Splendor (Taken) that are available.

I do have Favonius R2, Dark iron sword, Sacrificial R1 and Harbinger R5. I do have an iron sting too.

So now that Kazuha and Neuvillette are here where did the Chronicle wish banner go? Is that common during this time frame with liyue or does it disappear for the second half of banners? If so why not just make the banner 40 days for both phases rather than disappearing mid patch?
My impressions of Genshin after playing for one month as a low-ish cost player.|376
Hello! I posted about a month ago and I talked a bit about my initial thoughts of the game. I took all the advice you all gave me and kept learning. I finished my main JRPG (Trails of Cold Steel 4... so many hours have I invested into Kiseki....) and ended up putting some more time into Genshin.

This is like, one of the best games I have ever played. :)

I am a long timer gamer. I started with the NES as a wee child. Genshin has somehow managed to take the open world Anime fantasy adventure of my dreams and built a video game out of it.

As a free player, I had access to plenty of pulls from doing all the content and events. There's also all the outside stuff, like daily check-in and promotional codes. Those really add up with everything. I did spend about $30 total (some gems, the blessing, and the battle pass) so I did get a fair amount of extra pulls from that, but I was able to build a great beginning team thanks to some luck (Diluc, Fischl, and YaoYao are my current mains). All the characters are so fun to play, even the characters that I think are kind of boring are still fun to get and play around with for a little bit (Mika, Xinyan are some examples). All this is to say that my initial belief that "all gacha games are greedy" was extremely wrong! I think Genshin is extremely friendly to free players. More than that, it's a game I feel comfortable giving money to because of how well polished the game is and the scale of content I have access to.

I love watching MMO animes with my partner and this game has somehow captured the feeling of playing one of those animes. I was exploring Dragonspine for some Chilled Meat when I accidentally summoned a miniboss boar king. I was just exploring for a side quest that I wanted to do before work and ended up fighting for my life completely unprepared. That was a super fun moment!

I spent so much time in Mondstadt because the size of the map was a little overwhelming at first, but now that I'm expanding into Liyue, I'm kind of baffled at this game's scale. It is one of the most expensive games ever developed for a reason! I mean, dang. There's a collectable or a riddle or a chest or an interesting fight around every single corner. Every single drop has meaning. Nothing I pick up feels pointless. The world all feels like it has purpose and that is a wild breath of fresh air after the last decade of gaming.

I've also learned a lot about the elemental reaction system and have been super impressed how some enemies can be a royal pain in the butt until you figure out that you need to hit them with a certain reaction (looking at you, you stupid Fatui Skirmisher Electro jerk, try and waste my time again). I just unlocked Genius Invokation TCG and like, damn. I didn't need ANOTHER thing to get really into. This game within a game is super fun! It feels like a reward after slogging through four games of Blade and Vantage Masters (iykyk).

Last time I posted I was AR 12. Now I'm AR 32 and I can't believe how much content keeps unlocking for me. And something I think they do really well is that none of the content feels overwhelming to do. Even if it's a limited event, it doesn't take a lot of effort to complete and it's something I can do alongside my commissions. Worst part is getting an event in some far off part of the map I've yet to explore.

Anyways, that's my little review. Honestly a 9/10 game for me. I'm only taking away one point so that I have room to go up in case I love it even more in another month, haha.

A few of you suggested to save primogems for Neuvilette and I've done just that. I have about 50 pity from when I was still learning everything. This is my first big banner event where I'm gunning for a certain character, so wish me luck! :)(this entire post was written to please the gods of RNG, pls help me beat the 50/50 pity chance, Neuvilette be mine)  


edit: I got Nevuilette!!! Goodbye, I have to go find all his ascension mats :')
What strong teams could I build right now?|0
Finally got Neuvillette and Kazuha after saving up for months. These are all the characters I own right now, as shown in the images attached. 

My goal is to have at least two really good teams. I obviously want to use Neuvillette, Kazuha & Nahida, as they'll easily be my strongest characters once levelled up. 


*CONSTELLATIONS:*
All of them are C0 with the exception of:
- C6: Barbara
- C4: Noelle
- C2: Gaming, Xingqiu, Amber & Yanfei
- C1: Diona, Sucrose, Sayu, Beidou, Xinyan, Ningguang, Chongyyun & Collei
NO WAY|0

Laggy feeling after CPU upgrade|0
Recently i upgraded my cpu from R5 2600 to R5 3600. Genshin used to feel more smoother but after the cpu upgrade it feels like lagging when i move my mouse or aiming with a bow. Has anyone experienced this? My temps are normal btw and this problem only occurred on genshin.

Pull for Neuvilette rn or wait for Zhongli later?|0
There is my current cast for context purposes (two screenshots, open to see the full image)
  
Neuvilette is here again, and I know well how broken he is. However, I have been waiting for a chance to get Zhongli because of his OP shield, to complete my monogeo team, and give me more comfort with my gameplay (I play in my phone).
  
I could say that my next great goal in the game is to beat the abyss (no need for all stars, just beating the 12th floor would be awesome for me).

How long would it take me to get these characters? 

Team 1:
It is said that Wrio will rerun in 4.7 and I‘m praying that Thoma accompanies him.

As for Benny I heard he’ll rerun with Arle in 
4.6 but I’m not gonna waste my primos on her banner and just wait for him to be able available in the shop.

Team2:
Some say Ayato will get his rerun in 5.1 since there seems to be a pattern but idk.

As for Yelan some speculate that she won’t be on the Liyue banner in 4.7 and will get her rerun before 5.x?

I can‘t stand to wait any longer how long do you speculate that I’ll get all of them? Before 5.x or after 5.2?!? 
What are your inputs?
I’m fairly new (active for 66 days) but GI has me firmly gripped by my balls but I won’t spend any money on that game.

Favonius sword or iron sting for Kazuha? |0

When the Wind Dies Down FIX|0
If you're having an issue where you are unable to talk to Amber after the cutscene after defeating Stormterror or the quest saying "Character is involved in another quest. Cannot join this quest", simply restart your game. There should have been an option on your quest somewhere on the bottom giving you information on what quest exactly you need to complete before being able to continue with that one, but if you don't see it, restart your game. If that doesn't work, complete any side quests that you already started until there aren't any, then restart your game, then the button should show up. Hope this helps!

Why was the Chronicled wish banner only for the first half of the version? |1671
I'm still a bit confused about why it couldn't run all the way. With how many total characters there are now it was great to have an opportunity to get the very early Mondstat faces that don't get the spotlight anymore, while not taking spotlight from newer banners. 

Don't get me wrong, I love that they did it, but if it's for the "less popular ones", and you don't have anything else to put in it's place, why not leave it there? It would still be getting earnings, and give people more time to get characters that don't make nearly as much money as the other 2 that would be with them right now anyway... 

It's still better than if we had ANOTHER chronicled wish right away which would rerun Lyiue 5 stars, which are generally more popular and would be too much to go for all at once.

It just feels like while the new banner was a big plus, it could have been an even bigger one with no one losing anything on it and I'm dazzled they didn't take at that opportunity 
Just returned to Genshin and seeking advices|0
Hello everyone! OG player here, played since 1.2 but left the game in 2.8 because I had to focus on something else. Came back 6 days ago and I was shocked on how much content there is in the game rn, I can say im overwhelmed by it. Until now i finished the Sumeru Archon Quest and just started the first act of Fontanie but at the same time I want to farm some primos but the new areas are huge, nothing like I've experienced back then with Inazuma. From what I've heard Sumeru is pretty locked behind quests so in order to really explore it you just gotta do quests after quests, is it correct? How is Fontanie, and on what should I focus so i can farm some primos to get Arlechinno and maybe her weapon. Currently sitting at around 9.5k primos after 6 days of playing haha.
Download Updated Genshin?|0
Way to Download Updated Genshin?

Is there any way to straight up download an up to date version of Genshin? I haven't played/updated mine since 3.2 and updates can take literal days bc my download spd goes to like 50kb/s for some reason so it would take v long to update. I'm thinking I can just go to some place w high spd wifi to get it downloaded on a usb via laptop in one go (Genshin is on my pc so I can't really take it around). I have the space (500gb free space), I'm just wondering if there's a way to download the up to date game and maybe avoid the archived/old data like the Klee island event etc if possible. 

I'm not even sure if its possible, but if it is idt be appreciated

(not april fools btw)
how much crit rate for fav weapons?|5
congrulate me, i won my third 50/50 in a row and got kazuha!

and my options for him are:

iron sting r3
sac sword  r2
aaaand most likely, fav sword r4

i do not yet have a good 4p vv set for him, all my em pieces have shit substats, so his build's crit rate is %30 *maybe*

so im wondering, can he still proc fav sword's passive with such a crit rate? i'll likely still ise fav sword on him anyway, bc my vv pieces also dont have a lot of %er, or maybe the sac sword?

generally, if you put a fav weapon on a chara, how much crit rate does your build have to reliably procc the passive?

i put all my trash artifacts on vv strongbox, so hopefully i will see improvements on my new bby kazuha (without stealing venti's artifacts)

Xiangling vape team advice.|0
With my available units, I was thinking of making a team consisting of Xiangling, Xingiqu, Benny and Kazuha, but I need help building them/leveling them properly.

Xiangling is using The Catch, Xingqiu is using Wolf-Fang, Benny is using the Alley Flash and Kaz is using the Iron Sting. What artifacts should each of them be using, and in what order should I level each of their talents? Which of them are more/less important? Thanks for your help.

  
Edit: I also have access to C0 Sucrose. Should I use her instead of Kazuha in this team? Or is Kaz better?

I’m sitting here actually malding because I just finished another weeks worth of bosses to get literally nothing useful. I’m starting to resent this game because god damn there should be some kind of guarantee system on rewards that you can only even get ONCE PER WEEK.

Is there really no way to find which missing aranara you have?|0
I went through the whole interactive map to complete all of the Aranara. I suppose I must have marked one complete incorrectly, but I do not believe that I did. When I went to open the chests I could not open the last three. Is there really no way to see which one was missed? Checking them all again (especially when they have all mostly been found, so I don't know If I am checking the right spot or not) seems soul crushing.  


Edit: Thank you for this guide  [https://www.miyoushe.com/ys/article/28708647](https://www.miyoushe.com/ys/article/28708647) from u/SnooRobots4768.

If Cyno were to get a Chapter 2, what would you want to have happen in it?|0
I know there have been rumors that he might get one, but they're just rumors for now. There's no telling if he's actually going to get one anytime soon.

But on the subject, if he were to get one, what would you want to have happen in it?

I'm currently thinking of the following as a rough draft.

>The Traveler visits the Akademiya while Faruzan is tutoring Collei. During the session, Collei suddenly lashes out violently at those around her, as though possessed. Before she can hurt anyone, Cyno shows up and knocks her out. Cyno explains how Collei has dead god remnants in her body, and that despite how he sealed them away during the events of the official manga, something has caused the seal to fail. Cyno can't do the same thing he did last time, knowing it won't be a long-term solution to the problem, so they need to come up with a way to purge Collei of the god remains. Seeking Nahida's advice, they decide to search in the Great Red Sand for the answers.

>While searching, the group learns more about Cyno's own history, including the pact he made with Hermanubis, as well as his connection to High Priest Kasala. The group eventually finds a ritual chamber in a Domain where they can purge Collei of the god remains. Cyno performs the ritual, prompting the serpent god within Collei to attack them, but Cyno defeats and destroys it, cleansing Collei of its influence for good. As they leave, Cyno reveals how he had a similar history to Collei, having been experimented on and imbued with the essence of Hermanubis, but that he was raised by Cyrus to become the man he is today. Collei asks why he didn't use the ritual on himself. Cyno answers that he chooses to keep his pact with Hermanubis so he can continue to uphold the peace in Sumeru.

That's just the direction I'd go in. What would you do for Cyno's Chapter 2?

Anybody else feel like the Alchemical Ascension event was a tad underwhelming in terms of story?|0
I get that it was meant to be a filler event, but it feels like it could've done more with its story. There's a few things I think could've been done, though not necessarily all at once.

- ~~Looking into Lisa's shortened lifespan. This is only ever brought up in her character lore and isn't really spoken of by the characters. This event could've brought it up in some way, maybe with Lisa mentioning that she tried using alchemy as a way to extend her lifespan, but she either dropped the idea or it didn't work out.~~  
(Didn't know this aspect of Lisa's character was alpha-only content.)

- Some sort of mention of Rhinedottir. She's allegedly the best alchemist in Teyvat, yet there was no mention of her at all in an alchemy-centric event. Feels like a missed opportunity, even if it would've been a bit out there.

- An appearance by Albedo somewhere. Given he's the chief alchemist of Mondstadt, you'd think he'd have at least had one appearance, not just a mention. Sure, he got a good enough spotlight in Shadows Amidst Snowstorms, but ever since then he's fallen out of focus.

Maybe if we get another alchemy event in the future, we could explore some of those things in the story. Additionally, if we do get another alchemy event, there's a few ideas I have for stuff that could happen.

- ~~The Traveler tries to help Lisa come up with something to extend her shortened lifespan. It either doesn't work out or Lisa turns the offer down, claiming her shortened lifespan doesn't bother her.~~

- Itto and Shinobu show up and, after some weirdness, one of the Arataki Gang members suggests a potion that would allow Itto to eat tofu dishes. It doesn't work out, and Itto gets once again crippled by his bean allergy.

- Layla shows up for the event and asks for a potion to help her with sleep. It works so well that "Star's Blessing" Layla cannot even wake up to do "Daylight" Layla's tasks. However, it ends up working out for the best, letting Layla get in some good sleep for once.

- A mysterious woman shows up and, upon seeing the Traveler's work, remarks that they're a rank amateur at alchemy. When the Traveler and Paimon get angry with her, the woman uses their cauldron and brews a wonderous potion that would be totally beyond the Traveler's skill. The woman leaves without revealing their identity. Later on, Albedo shows up and sees the potion and believes it to be Rhinedottir's work. However, he is incredulous as to why his master and creator would show up, as she's normally a recluse who is obsessed with her experiments.

Anybody else hoping that we'll get another alchemy event in the future with a bit more story to it?

Lost 50/50 on Neuve's banner today. 

I'd stopped playing in mid Sumeru and since then I was absent for more than a year. I just returned in this patch after a long time. I was already regretting that I'd missed so many great units like Furina, Alhaitham, Neuve, Navia, Xiyanyun. So I aimed for Neuvilette. But this is the first time that I got a 5 star at 90 pity and on top of it I lost the 50/50. I knew that this is 50/50 but I was a little positive that I'd win it. And even if I lost it I'd still get around 40-50 pulls if I recharge my welkin, do exploration and quests. I still have 60 percent of Fontaine unexplored. And Sumeru is almost 40-50% unexplored. On top of it I haven't done any Archon quests since Nahida and there are tons of world quest since Sumeru. I haven't done any story quests and those dating with character quest since Sumeru. 

But I'm not motivated enough. What do you guys suggest, should I grind again to try my luck on Neuve's banner (if not get him then maybe Arlecchino) or should I start saving till Natlan units? I'm currently not in my right mind to think straight, just a moment ago I was about to uninstall the game.

Thank you.

Natlan land of debuffs|0
With Fontaine have their characters focus on hp and arkhe, I think Natlan’s will also share some mechanic. It made sense with Fontaine since not a lot of characters focused on hp outside of hp scaling. I would like it if Natlan focused on debuffs. 

I’m talking about elemental shred, interruption resistance, D.O.T., Slow effects.

With it being the land of war what if they didn’t care about the Geneva Conventions. Skills that blind, or a Burst sets and enemy on fire that can’t be vaporized and lowers their defense.

Any thoughts on what GI can do in future to reduce space?|0
It’s not really that big a deal on PCs anymore since you can always buy more storage or even an external one to house GI files. 

I’m more concerned about mobile gaming. I usually play Genshin on PC but download it on mobile as well when I am travelling/away on business to do my dailies/weeklies. 

Some things, such as the ability to delete old quest files after completion has helped a lot but we all know Genshin continues to grow bigger and bigger each patch. 

Some ideas my friends and I came up with are as follows:

1. Delete game files of certain lands (Chasm, Dragonspine, Enka) that we no longer visit and this will disallow us to teleport there when in the app unless we re-download the files. 

2. Release a Genshin Impact Lite version app that only allows us to do weeklies/daily commissions and use resin on domains only. 

3. Force us to buy phones with bigger space 🤣 I know I’m gonna go for the 1TB iPhone from next year on. 128GB used to be enough for me before I had to download Genshin on my phone.  

Really open for discussion! I’d like to know if you guys know of any other games that has had this issue and what were their solutions? Or maybe you have an interesting idea too?


Help! Who should I pull?|0
hello! I'm having some trouble deciding what characters I want to pull in the upcoming banners and wanted to see what do you think!

I'm currently considering pulling for neuvillette, furina, Wriostheley, yelan c1, zhongli. I'm tempted to pull this banner as I want to c6 xingqiu as well. I'm currently leaning towards Wriostheley because I like his character and Furina because I like her healing mechanism, but I'm not too sure.

Some additional info!
Some characters I have (all c0): Raiden, Nahida, Yelan, Xingqiu, Tighnari, Bennett, Fischl, Xiangling, Sucrose, Diona, Yanfei, Noelle, Beidou, Mika, Gaming, Heizou, Yaoyao, Lynette, Yunjin, Ningguang, Faruzan, Freminet, Chevreuse

Do you have any advice or any possible team comps I can do with the upcoming banners?

Q for the seasoned players regarding in-game shop RNG|0
New player here (AR27 ~ 66 hrs total playtime incl ~ first 3 hrs when I first installed the game just messing around). Last 3 weeks really got into Genshin Impact that pretty much became obsessed with the game playing on PS5, my Asus Ally & phone.

I’ve spent ~ $225 USD to date on banner pulls (about 190~200 pulls all up. So far I got the non banner 5 star from last banner - Tigharni & only got Neuvillette s it was pretty much guaranteed at 80 pulls today). Ironically I got Neuvillette on 70-80th pulls which is pretty much pity system triggered. 

**My question to the veterans here:**

**Is it pretty normal in Genshin Impact to be constantly hitting the tail end of the pity system & often missing banner 5 star pulls?**

I love this game & I’m gonna settle in a bit and continue to grind more for upgrades/crafting but just curious what the average RNG is like because my onboarding experience to this game has been pretty much unlucky lol. Still happy to support the devs & at this rate I’m paying ~ $2.50 per hour of entertainment which isn’t bad at all!

Say that you gave Jeht a unique voice actor. Who would you pick in English?|0
Jeht is unvoiced during her World Quests (for obvious reasons), but uses the generic Desert Clearwater voice during combat. Still, you can't help but wish she could've had a unique voice actor.

If she were to have one, who would you pick in English?

My pick would be Michelle Ruff.  
https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0741398/  
I absolutely loved her work as Sinon, Etna, Rita, Yukari, etc. Dunno why Hoyo hasn't reached out to her for at least one role in either Genshin or HSR.
Aside from hydro damage goblet ( I used one with some crit rate/damage ), what else can I improve ?|0

I pulled for kazuha over neuvillette|0
So I had a five star guaranteed over next 20 wishes and i pulled for kazuha instead of neuvillette. I didn't have a character who could do crowd control and also i faced problem with abyss when i had to play using two teams. Currently only one of my team is powerful and that too is carried by xiao. 

I just like kazuha's gameplay a lot. Its comfortable for me. That isn't to say i didn't like neuvi it's just i like kazuha so much more. Tbh i feel a little robbed for having both of them at the same banner. Maybe if neuvi was released with chiori instead i would have wished for him. 

Should I still try to wish for neuvi? I mean the banner is here to stay for next twenty days. I just don't have any characters to build around him. The only other hydro characters i have is xingqiu and barbara. Also i dont have any good cryo characters. I have my kaeya built but his cryo is only good at close range and i feel neavi tends to fight long range? 

Anyways i was looking to build a second team for abyss. Please suggest me something. I will mention the characters i already have. 

Xiao, kazuha, lynette, traveler 

tighnari, collei, kaveh

xiangling, yanfei, thoma, amber, bennett
 
xingqiu, barbara

freminet, kaeya

dori, lisa

gorou, yun jin, noelle

Does anyone still remember this place?|93

Just Recently noticed that I surpassed 1k of days in this game|119
Surprised I didn't spend any money on this game
After finishing Fontaine and her story quest I think Furina is easily the best character in Genshin|427

The pure determination required to get through her 500 year struggle to save the Fontainians is some of the most emotionally compelling writing this game has so far, and I like the story quest is used as a sweet epilogue for her. She definitely deserves that vision

When it comes to the overall Fontaine Archon quest I really enjoyed the investigation and trial elements, and I like that they leaned into Noah’s ark parallels. 

Sumeru and Fontaine were huge jumps in quality for me and I hope it continues into Natlan
Turns out Paimon SFH is Premium Bandai…|52

What's your favourite thing about each Region thus far? |7
For me,

Mondstadt - how small, idyllic and quaint it is.

Liyue - culture, mountains and villages. 

Inazuma - the vibe. The region's release was some of my favourite moments ever.

Sumeru - how it seamlessly incorporates rainforest and desert enviornments and juggles exploration. It's hella impressive. 

Fontaine - I dreaded Fontaine because I'm claustrophobic, but the diving mechanics are excellent, and the architecture slaps.

Dragonspine - soundtrack.

Chasm - defeating the Black Serpent Knights daily.



Aight so how much fowl am I getting out of this guy?|1517

Top 10 Genshin Impact ships for the first three months of 2024 (AO3)|0
Hello, dear r/Genshin\_Impact subreddit, today I, Vivi, present you with statistics on the top 10 ships in the first three months of 2024 in the Genshin Impact fandom on [AO3](https://archiveofourown.org/). Tomorrow? Who knows.

**Disclaimer: I am doing this for fun, I do not have a background in mathematics or statistics. Please don’t take it too seriously.**

I will only be showcasing the top ten ships from January to March as a whole. The individual stats per month can be found in [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vS_b9aIr5LuXueRPQWxddAcRW7ifQUWorxWkzu7XsnfAbavsijM4CQzL82c7MJXZbe8iaKqODxHgQUK/pubhtml?gid=0&single=true) Google sheet.

(I flaired this post as a discussion, as I want to invite discussion about the stats. I hope that is okay.)

# What is AO3?

I’m well aware that some of y’all might not be familiar with AO3. AO3 stands for Archive of Our Own and is a fanfiction archive. It is kind of similar to Fanfiction.net or Wattpad.

The Genshin Impact fandom is one of the largest fandoms on the website having a total of 174,636 published works at the time of me writing this. So, I thought it would interesting to compile stats of the most written ships in the first quarter of 2024.

**One more important thing: the / symbol is used to depict romantic relationships, while the & symbol indicates platonic relationships.** (I counted both platonic and romantic relationships for this)

# Top 10 Genshin Impact ships Jan-Mar on AO3

Environmental Effects in Abyss|0
'Abyss Floor 13' is discussed pretty often, but I think if it was just 'tankier, higher DPS' bosses it'd be pretty meaningless. 

So what would you guys think if the Abyss began to be more than just a flat arena? Stuff like grass burning, high & low land, rain, sheer cold/heat etc. could really shake up the meta, strategies, and gameplay. It'd make stronger contrast between ranged and melee DPSs too. Would this make you more/less interested in Abyss? 
Fontaine military |0
If Fontaine is based off of 1800s France,  would there be a Napoleon variant for Fontaine? I mean muskets already exist, and since Fontaine military is based off of France, they should have a Napoleon of their own, right? They've already got muskets, probably artillery, so their military should be able to advance, yes?
Unlocked Neuvillette but what now?|0
Hi, so I am relatively new player and I just unlocked Neuvillete because like every genshin player on earth said so and I like him so far! Well like-D?, because I just found out from his ascention to ALL his talents requires stuff from fontaine which I have still not unlocked.

I can unlock it I think, I am AR 50+ but I don't want to until I complete my Inazuma Archon quest. I hate unlocking new areas before the traveller decides/talks he has to go to a new place next. (I haven't unlocked Sumeru and I don't even participate in challenges that happen in Sumeru/Fontaine 😭)

So, I thought for ascention I can go to a friends world to get Fortemer Unicorn and Lumitoile ans buy the Pearls he need  from Stardust Exhange. BUT then I saw that ALLL his talents also requires stuff from fontaine and I wanna die. I don't want to regret pulling from him but Idk what to do now. 

I don't want to unlock new areas until the story asks me to. What should I do?
Neuvillette rerun! Let the mighty be humble!|26
Let us appreciate this mighty DPS 😊
And be nice to Melusines...or else.
Should I get back into genshin?|0
Joined  like shortly after  inazuma and left around  dehya premiered and pulled her.  Took a few breaks during that time but I was on pc. Pc broke recently and got back into starrail because I was bored but genshin on mobile is not as accessible as star rail is. But I hit a wall with star rail as I made the mistake of getting my equilibrium level above what I have characters for and not enough energy to farm for mats for them so I need something in the meantime 
Now this is how you do encounter points, not like that Combat event a few days ago|4615
This is all from the slime event btw
genshin don't want to download properly|0
1) was working fine the other day(2days ago)

2) next day(yesterday morning) it wasnt able to locate the game even tho it's there and i can manually open it through launcher (tried the already instaled? locate game function it didnt work i tried multiple times even after restarting my pc it was like that)

3) reinstalled the game new problem arose verification error retry to download or something popped up retried several times didn't work

4) i found a post in the hoyolab that has the fix "cloudfare 1.1.1.1"  tried it it did kinda work after like several retries it got to 65gb or something before the error popped up before i tried the cloudfare it can only download till 20gb then i retried it again it did download now to verification part i think it verified it or not (i'm not sure i was on my phone since verification takes long time)  then the whole download restarted after it just downloaded it

5) the error occurred again but now it's saying that i dont have enough space ( i only had enough space left for genshin ) so i wondered why because it redownloaded and as i see, it was trying to download everything again from 0 it 

6) i tried to delete the files it downloaded but can't delete for some reason i suspected it was the same as what happened to my hsr the day before no.1 it was able to open but only black screen the files were undeletable and corrupted so i reinstalled it to my other drive(hdd to ssd) after i deleted it in safemode now back to genshin it had the same problem undeletable corrupted files but i can't do the same to hsr since my ssd doesn't have enough space 

7) i already tried asking in the hoyolab forums before i did no.4 but my post only got 1 like also tried here in reddit but only got a downvote deleted both since i had lost my hope to those 

please help i already searching google they just said the same thing "restart internet" it wasn't any help

i think the corrupted files/folders was the same in hsr however hsr had one more folder that is in the same case as this 

[name of the folder of what got corrupted in both genshin and hsr ](https://preview.redd.it/sj3b37cko1sc1.png?width=550&format=png&auto=webp&s=b399a8e56d3ae14c42194feb1bb3c9f0820ad63b)
My Genshin looks kind of different today|130

Which to prioritize between Neuvillette’s sig weapon and C1|0
I got furina as support and zhongli as shielder, as for his weapon i only got the prototype amber. Any tips which should go for?
Who's actually responsible for the Abyss Order's creation |0
I wanted to make this a really long time ago but forgot, so I thought why not now.

So as we know that the Abyss Order was founded by Clothar Alberich after the events of the Caribert Questline. 
But could that have changed if Kusanali wasn't stuffed in the Rukhadevta ball? 

We see how much Clothar hated the Gods yet he was still ready to forsake his hatrate for the sake of his son even to go as far as to how and beg in front of the Dendro Archon's statue. 
When I was playing the quest even I was thinking for a second that of course Kusanali will help him but then nothing happened and then realisation struck, she can't help him even if she wants to because the Akademiya have her under house arrest inside the Rukhadevta ball. 

Of course and argument can be made that Clothar would eventually might've turned bad anyway but still do you think the former short-sighted  Akademiya sages are responsible for the creation of the Abyss Order?

2. Of course khaenriah can also be considered equally as responsible seeing how they were responsible for the cataclysm that lead to Rukhadevta going to protect Irminsul and eventually meeting her end and creating Kusanali who was then subsequently captured and isolated due to her just being a child 

What do you think?

Daily Questions Megathread (April 02, 2024)|21
Ask about anything about the game that doesn't necessarily require a dedicated thread.

That is, if your question can be answered rather quickly/without significant  difficulty (e.g. "Can my phone run this game?"), ask here. If you think your question can contribute to some constructive discussions (e.g. "What do you think of Amber's combat efficiency? Here's my opinion."),  make a particular post with the "discussion" flair.

Doing the Sumeru Archon Quest for the first time post Nahida banner is fun :)|4
Yes, it has taken me this long to get to it
Who was the character that made you question your sexuality? 👀|0

Is anyone else struggling with the new event or is it just me?|0
I was excited for it, but so far I find myself barely able to reach the minimum reward level. The cannon controls are way too sensitive and even then, there's almost never enough time to properly plan the placement. It's more tan likely that I simply suck at games like these, but I'm curious if anyone else feels the same.
After all these years I finally got it|21
I finally got my 1st qiqi after 3 years of playing the game. Ngl kinda felt left out b4, getting a qiqi feels like a rite of passage in this community.

Now the only standard 5 star character I'm missing is diluc :)
