Assign a Pokemon||0
I want to assign each character a Pokemon (for fan art), but I’m very uncreative. Let’s work together. Assign a Pokemon to your favorite characters. Could be aesthetic, lores, or anything (include explanation).

I’ll start with a few: Barbara-Primerina, Itto-Terrakion, Gaming-Pyroar, Diluc-Talonflame.
Thoughts?||0
I'm quite confused as to why some genshin players (or majority of them) still keeps coming back to the game after "quitting" or "deleting" the game, granted I'm not veteran player who played the game since released (I started playing since the release of sumeru). The common answers that I saw were "Genshin is boring now", "No upcoming endgame content or plans", "Genshin is dead",  "The game is not generous to keep playing it", "Genshin is getting repetitive", & "Hsr is much more fun and generous so I deleted genshin". And yet when a new character or a new area & nation releases they keep coming back to play the game and afterwards they "Quit" or "leave" the game "again". 

One counter argument they usually say is "I've invested so much money, time & effort in the game so I can't just quit" but then again they've keep "leaving" or "quitting" the game. Some or majority of them transferred to playing HSR because of the Generosity of HSR, more difficult endgame content, & easiness of grinding. I'm afraid that the true fans of HSR or the Honkai community in general will encounter a internal conflict with "Former" genshin players in HSR because "SOME" of the players that came from GI that started playing HSR got greedy when the hsr devs gives a free Dr. Ratio, abundance of Rewards from the anniversary and the players speculating a "free" aventurine (Which is very unlikely & unrealistic to happen). 

This is just my simple take or observations on the current situation of genshin players that are "quitting" or "leaving" the game.

Was Paimon always this loud?||0
For context, I started playing Genshin when it released and kept playing until 3.7, when I ultimately decided to take a long break (too much desert lol). I returned to the game around 2 weeks ago, and have been catching up with the story ever since. And man... Was Paimon always this loud?

Now I don't mean to say she's annoying. In fact, I've always been a Paimon apologist because I think she's really sweet, funny and very well portrayed as the Traveler's best friend and companion. But something that I've been noticing in the past few days is how whenever she speaks, my ears literally hurt. And I don't mean this as an hyperbole, I was legit flinching every time one of her lines started playing because of how constantly it goes high-pitch. It also feels like it gets worse because of the compression on the voice lines in general. Obviously every character's lines are compressed to an extent for the sake of space, but with Paimon, the very slight audio "cracks" are more noticeable, because of said high-pitch. Even lowering the volume didn't help much, I'm playing with the music volume on 7, whereas voice and sound effects are on 4. Still hard to hear. At this point I might need to lower my volume even further during cutscenes lol.

Was this always a thing? I remember that I bought my current headset about a month before taking a break from the game, so I \*did\* play it with the same headset back then for a while. Maybe I just didn't play any voiced quests in that period and thus didn't notice it. But holy cow, this little flying fairy must have a thing against eardrums.

Yo straight up, cat event is disappointing.||2719
I wanted to name the cat Tofu! Fuck you Paimon, sick of you naming everything.

Also it's supposed to be an event about putting furniture together for cats, but there's only one correct combination? What's the point? They could have made this like the Aranara event where you come mix and match the items. But if everybody just does the exact same thing why have us pick furniture at all?

Not to mention Mona and other characters that show up aren't even voiced, just lazy all around.

Petting the kitties is lacluster too.

I was hoping it'd be as good as the cooking event. =(

Can we all appreciate how Genshin handled a court trial so beautifully||3
Apparently, today's livestream announcement made me realise how close we are actually to Natlan and how majority of Fontaine's story is over.

One thing, I haven't seen being discussed is the trial side of all the quests. I have seen many shows and movies take on court proceedings in their plot and many have failed in it and many have passed. For Genshin tho, I was sceptical how would they handle it in game and with the theme of Opera.

I am so glad it was done this way. From, lighting to music to even dialogues everything was so good. I personally haven't attended any real trial so I don't know about realism part, but apart from that this was so well done. Like even the plot points, it was so thoroughly written well, it automatically became investing.

One little thing I catch here is, see how the court is divided here(refer the pic) by sides. What I mean is, who are or will be judged are always seated in the right, whereas who judges seats in the left. This shows, Furina who was although above all was also going to being judged at the end after all.

One more thing, notice how all of sumeru interlude was about deceiving the fate & how only a God can have a little chance of pulling it off, and the very next whole of Fontaine archon quest is actually that being pulled off.

Nevertheless, back to the topic, I am very happy and satisfied how the court proceedings were designed and written.

Ask about anything about the game that doesn't necessarily require a dedicated thread.

That is, if your question can be answered rather quickly/without significant  difficulty (e.g. "Can my phone run this game?"), ask here. If you think your question can contribute to some constructive discussions (e.g. "What do you think of Amber's combat efficiency? Here's my opinion."),  make a particular post with the "discussion" flair.

Heads up, you can get welkins for just 50p if you have a samsung device||136
On the first day of every month, you get a 90% off voucher in the galaxy store, this can be used on the welkin to get it for 50p. I've used this several times and almost got a year of welkin through it. I'm honestly not sure if this is UK exclusive but it's worth checking. Also you'll need to download genshin through the galaxy store to use the voucher.

Edit: It's located in a gift icon in the top right of the store page. Also while checking the app I got a 50% genshin coupon as well so there's even more offers to get as well

Would different kinds of resin be an improvement to the resin system?||0
The thing about the resin system I dislike a lot is how much you have to spend your resin on. Like what if you still haven't fought your weekly boss yet, but you also need to artifact farm for a character, and get weapon/talent ascension material only available that day? Having to selectively choose what to spend your small amount of resin on is so painful and really makes leveling your characters/weapons slower and harder. My proposal would be different resin for different kinds of resin gated challenges. 

Different Resins:

1. Weekly boss resin
2. resin for normal bosses
3. artifact domain resin
4. talent domain resin
5. weapon domain resin

I feel like this would be fair. 180 resin each could really help people get stuff done and be able to equally distribute their resources.

An interesting detail about Furina's eyelashes||1324
Her eyelashes look like the beaded eyelashes that were popular during the era of silent film. Beaded eyelashes were a popular but difficult-to-execute style of lashes in the 1920s. The technique consisted of melting a type of cosmetic eyelash coating or just straight-up black wax and applying beaded pieces of it to the ends of the eyelashes (real or fake) often with something like an orange wood stick.

And if you are wondering why? The answer is...expression! During the 1920s, films were still silent so there were no speaking parts. The actresses, (like Bebe Daniels) had to emote through their facial expressions. Lashes like these brought attention to their expressive eyes and greatly enhanced their performance.

These lashes are not only limited to the silver screen, stage actresses also often wear them to ensure that their faces are visible from the back of the audience and that the emotions that they are portraying are enhanced by their eyes.

IDK if it was intentional or not but a cool observation nonetheless given how her story has played out.

Honestly, it was kind of challenging but once I got the pattern and / or rotation down, I was able to clear with 3 stars in all parts. This is what happens when you dedicate stamina items for that. Though now I don't have stamina items, and the free grind trial is over for me lol

First line-up was with Kazuha, Furina, Ganyu (IK it's cope), Neuvillette (who has c1 and signature).

Second line-up was Fischl, Xingqiu, Zhongli, Navia. Navia is so strong, I know it's because of current biweekly effect, but her fully charged skill deals 100k+ damage, and she's not even fully leveled to 80 or 90, her weapon is still LV 70, talents level 6 though at least. The reason I used Xingqiu is because with him there was more consistency in getting full charges for Navia crystallize. Go Navia, go!

Anyways, I probably won't be able to do it again for the foreseeable future. It was possible due to current abyuss cycle, I'm sure it's not going to be the same again.

Account||0
Greetings, travelers. It's been well over a year since I last played my main account. It's locked and I want to retrieve it because I regained passion from playing after being burnt out.

Well, the story is, my Facebook account (which is the account binded with my main account) got disabled (ceased from activation). I really want this one back because of the progress I'd made. Could I have someone guide me into retrieving this back? I'm quite sure that it's still possible to be retrieved, since I've seen someone from other r/ made it happen. Albeit, I have no contact of the person and it was a couple years ago. 

That's all. May the gods guide you in your travels.

What about Genshin trailers||0
So I'll start by saying I love this game to death, I'm a player from day 1 and still enjoying the game and what it has to offer.
Recently with the blow at HSR and their new character, Acheron, I started playing the game again after I dropped it like half a year ago.
I really liked the theme, lore and gameplay they made for her.
And if I'm being completely honest, it made me jealous for the game I love so much.
Why is it that they go to such lengths with their teaser, demos and some characters even receiving fully animated trailers, they are more generous with their rewards to the players.
It feels like they are going doing more to their players in hsr and take us for granted.
Now I'm not saying that they are not putting any effort into the genshin, for example the Xianyun demo showed that they are going up in quality.
I guess I just can't help but compare the two since it's the same company, even if probably each game has their own departments.
But maybe someone can enlighten me with real and serious answers.

I've been requesting this in all survey suggetion for the past year.

I finally got the build I wanted for Klee. She can have improved but right now, I'm super happy! She's lv 90, 2 piece gladiator and 2 piece crimson witch with lv 90 lost prayers and she does great! She consistently does 20k charge attack with melt or vap. And a least 10k-15k on any other time. She has at least 2k attack. She finally good DPS status and can even take out enemies all on her own! My Klee might be average to some people but I'm so happy that the cutest character can hit like a truck! Even her skill is hitting 8k to 15k. I think I even saw 20k at one point. I feel so much joy at how amazing she's doing! She doesn't even have pyro goblet as I don't have a good on. I'm planning on maining her until AR 60 as I love her so much! She's my third fave and the cutest!! I just wanted to tell someone how happy I am with her and never regret pulling for her!!! Thanks for reading my rant lol.

The last stage of Rolling Crossfire is actually quite fun||3
The control of the event could be a little bit counter-intuitive at first, but you get used to it after playing for a while. On the other hand, the mechanism of **dynamic difficulty** adds extra challenge and learning curve to the last stage, meaning you could play it multiple times to gradually adapt and strategize, which therefore means some replay value. I feel like the event's gameplay could definitely be further fleshed out with more complexity and depth to make it a fun replayable minigame.

What's the highest score you've got in the last round? Took me quite a few tries to get to 20k and it feels like it would be much harder to grind for a higher score beyond the 20k point.

Hero the Copy Cat||0
Ok here is a very briefly thought out concept of a 5 star I have been thinking of for a while. Almost definitely overpowered, but I wanted to balance that by making them a weird fit. Basically I image them as being a sub DPS and Support at the same time. I also want them to be from the new Pyro Nation along with this other character I have been thinking about to a much more in depth degree. Please tell me what you think about Hero! I really like the idea behind them but understand it would be hard to balance and implement.

Hero the Copy Cat (Cryo Catalyst, they/them)
- [ ] Normal attack: Makes ice versions of the physical weapons. 6 hit chain. First 2 are the sword, second 2 are spear, last 2 are a claymore.
- [ ] Charged attack: Freezes the air into an ice bow, rapidly charging a magic ice arrow. After charging like a normal bow, the arrow will create 3 ice clusters around the tip. When fired, the arrow will split into 3 homing projectiles.
- [ ] Plunging attack: Standard catalyst plunge, but upon landing there is an AOE visual effect of a mini Rosaría’s ult (no extra damage).
- [ ] Elemental Skill: Creates a small area of effect that enhances attack speed of allies within. Upon dealing damage, the active character (something you do with the Pyro Nation’s gimmick). Lasts for 6 seconds. Cooldown is 8 seconds.
- [ ] Burst: Calls upon their allies, imbuing their experiences and knowledge into ice sculptures the hero makes. Upon creation, these figures become animated and cast their elemental skills. These skills, however, become imbued with the cryo element (Furina’s summons will deal cryo damage instead of hydro). This resets cooldowns for the full team’s elemental skill. Increases damage of the skill by 150% for duration. If skill is used by the original character it will replace the current skill effects on the field (ie. If Furina takes the field after this ult and summons her pals, they will replace the cryo versions.) (If used in coop and there is more than one Hero on the team, then the inactive hero will be summoned to use their skill. If there is no inactive Hero [ie. both Hero’s are on the field] then no Hero copy will be created)
- [ ] Passive 1: The weapons summoned by Hero’s basic and charged attack become visual copies of their ally’s equipped weapons. This also grants a weakened version of those weapons’ passives the this character. If there are two units with the same type of weapon, one weapon will be chosen at random for the chain.
- [ ] Passive 2: The copies summoned by the burst will now stay around for a max of 5 secs where they will auto attack surrounding enemies using cryo versions of their weapons (deals only cryo damage and gains the weakened passive of their weapon. Hero cannot utilize Passive 1 until the copies fade. These copies have half the strength of the real versions. Can be destroyed if HP is reduced to 0) (This effect will not summon other versions of Hero. If there are two Hero’s on the team, the inactive Hero will be summoned, use their skill, then fade as if the active Hero did not have Passive 2. If there is no inactive Hero on the team, then no copy of Hero will be summoned).
- [ ] C1: If the full team is catalyst users, then Hero will summon only basic weapons, but their catalyst will switch between their allies’ catalysts for each of their 6 attacks (random order, always retains their original weapon’s passive). Charge attack is still the same. Passive 1 grants the full passive of the allies’ weapons to Hero.
- [ ] C2: Basic attack up 3 levels
- [ ] C3: 
- [ ] C4: 
- [ ] C5: Burst up 3 levels
- [ ] C6: Perfect Imitation. Each weapon Hero summons due to Passive 1 becomes a r5 version while Hero has it summoned. The stats of the passive are no longer weakened by the effects of Passive 1. Hero also adopts the fighting animation for their current teammates.
- [ ] Signature Weapon: Main stat= ATK. Passive= Gain stat buff for each team member with a different weapon type. Gain different stat buff for each unit with the same weapon type (catalyst)
- [ ] Idle animation: summons the cryo copies of their current teammates and poses with them to take a selfie.

Predicting future patches in Genshin Impact.||0
I wipped up a little chart on what each patch will contain in a future series of patches. I looked at previous series, and used patterns that I've seen in 2.x, 3.x, and 4.x. I didn't put in much consideration from 1.x because it's an outlier when it comes to the other patches. I put a picture of iansan in the background because the next series is 5.x, but this also applies to future series as well. This chart is going off of if a patch has an archon quest and or a new region to explore. I just call patches that have both god patches.

We all love this game and thats why we’re here. No offense to anyone but sometimes we do get frustrated due to bad luck in gacha rng, Abyss runs or other bad luck in this game that makes some people create hilarious slander names. 

I saw one recently thats making me laugh out anytime I think of it, “Emblem of severe shit domain” 😂😂😂

The other one that stuck to me for a long time was “Staff of homeless” before they brought the weapon banner pity system

How do people go over that? I don't have any other "showcase" characters
Are you ready for Father?||320

A small rant, i hope it's constructive enough to not get removed. :)||0
1.) City reputation vendors really need to give hints and/or conditions for world quests, and not just titles that can mean so many things. Not right away, and most certainly not in the beginning, while new quests get collected naturally, but near the end, when only like 5 or so quests are still incomplete and are likely not even in the journal yet. There's 3 quests in Chenyu Vale that i didn't get anywhere, and apparently i can't yet, not before making progress in Fontaine, the freaking last region before Chenyu Vale that came after both Inazuma and Sumeru! Yet those quests are handled by a Liyue reputation vendor.

2.) What is wrong with keys for Shrines of Depths in Liyue region? I have two sub-regions at 100%, the Chasm at 93% (will come back to it after inazuma) and all other sub-regions at/above 95%, have 4 world quests to complete (3 from Chenyu Vale and one in the Chasm), maxed reputation, and no clue where last three keys are supposed to come from. Back in Mondstadt, i got all the keys before getting to 100% everywhere, only don't remember exactly where did last three came from. It's the opposite situation in Liyue. They should've come into my hands naturally by now, as i was progressing the region.

3.) Remember that i mentioned one incomplete world quest in the Chasm? Can't complete it, because the boss lady that i need to report to, isn't even there. Her spot is empty, her crew is gone, there's bunch of Milelith, yet the quest marker peacefully points the place where she should be standing. If there was a prerequisite quest that needed to be completed first, why did the game allow me to lead this current quest to the very end, only to tell me "whoops, can't do that, tough luck, buddy"?

I am well aware that i can just look up everything related to all three issues, but i shouldn't have to. It all should have been handled by the game itself a bit better.

If you came this far, sincerely thank you for reading. Ignore if you feel like it. Rant over.

Now where do i spend my resin?? Im a newborn AR 59. I dont want my resin to rot away... Moreover, I dont know which characters to level up in advance for arle or clorinde. Though i have built chevreuse for Arlecchino.

Will Arlecchino be worth it or I might waste potential in boosting my team?||0
Hi, I’m a North America player playing from the Philippines. I average 200+ ping, which is not bad at all to be honest.

But I am quite stuck in an iffy since there are 3 characters I wanted that are close.

I have C1 Navia, Childe, Wriothesley, Al Haitham, Yoimiya, Arataki Itto, C1 Zhongli, Nahida, Lyney, C2 Qiqi, Dehya, Albedo, Yae Miko and C4 Keqing. They’re all built and have their dedicated supports. 

None of my 5*’s have their BIS 5*’s, with Navia being an exception for having a WGS. But I struggle a lot in Abyss 12th floor. The 11th floor was an easy sweep.

Now then, I wonder who should I get.. 
my pity is at 75+ and I have 6 wishes btw. So like, just incase I might regret Neuvilette and Kazuha if Arlecchino does perform badly.

So, in your opinion: Who should I get?
I drew two of my best teams, can you guess who they are?||14
It may be too easy idk, or maybe too difficult cause I drew all of these at like 2:00 am with no reference, but I thought it would be a fun little thing to do, so can you guess who is who?
How did you guy deal with the time gaps between your desired banner as a newbie? ||16
As common practice, we should save our precious primogems for the characters we want. That means 90 to 180 pulls for the pity. As oldbies with a decent roster, you will have no trouble with that. 

However for a newbie like me who only has the free and starting 4* characters with no 5*. My desired character is Raiden Shogun (and some others but mostly Raiden). But her banner was in January and i started in March 7th. So now i have to play and save for her for god-knows how long, maybe 1 year? While having no new characters whatsoever since i won't do gacha pulls. 

So, how did or how would you guys deal with that problem? Should i just doing pulls randomly to get characters and trying to save the pity for her later? 
My coolest genshin merch find in Japan so far (all contents in pictures)||58
I decided I'd walk down to the Bookoff location in Shinsaibashi in Osaka today after going to the clinic a short walk away before heading back home to Kyoto and take a quick look around the shop. While scanning through the figure section I stumbled upon this Melodies of an Endless Journey online concert 2021 goods set in pretty much brand new condition for just ¥4,400 and I knew I just had to pick it up. The set includes a very nice folder containing official orchestral scores of the opening theme, Mondstadt theme, Liyue theme and Inazuma theme, a Japanese 色紙(shikishi), standard post card, pin, and concert CD set (both disks and booklet listing the concert program). I may or may not have completely nerded out over the orchestral scores because I'm a musician (＞人＜;)

[New Player] Will there ever be an option to replay the limited story events or to at least have an in-game timeline of their story in conjunction with the main questline?||0
I just finished Liyue archon questline at AR 33, "A new Star approaches" (requires AR 28 to start) , and headed towards Mondstadt. And this was me intentionally slowing down my AR and character leveling up experience as soon as I got to Liyue because it felt like the game was not getting harder. I really liked the pacing I had with Mondstadt but as soon as I stepped foot on Liyue, it felt like I was always overleveled but later I realized this was because several quests that weren't in the game before (v1.0) were added late which I guess what made the pacing suddenly inconsistent.

I didn't mind this but I'm worried that this issue is about to get worse and it's demotivating to continue playing. And as someone who tried the game mainly out of interest for its story, theme, and characters, recently an immersion breaking experience have started to creep in, and it was when characters I've never heard of or met before have started to pop up on Mondstadt or on some other quests including limited events. Although I was immersed and enjoying the game so far, I'm looking for a way to remedy this issue because I don't want to keep pretending my canon Aether had an amnesia for these characters I've never met before.

P.S. I would appreciate it if someone can give us resources to fill up these blank spaces in my Aether's dementia issue for present and future references.

If Genshin collabs with HSR, what character would you want from HSR to be added with the collab?||0
Personally, I would want Topaz for two reasons. First, because I so desperately want Numby for exploration. Second, it'd be funny to see the IPC pull up to Teyvat for tax fraud.

What just happened? (Noob alert) ||1022

I just beat Raiden for the first time with level 50 characters without any food or revive and I am hella confused. 

I'm pretty sure the game was helping me in the second phase by boosting my ult recharge (I used Barbara's ult like 5 time) and I think my damage was also boosted massively by the game. 

I'm so confused... why did the game just hand me the win? I literally just brute forced through her with Kaeya and Xiangling without even realising it. I started the fight as a joke and to groove to the music and ended up in disbelief. I didn't know the fight would help me like that. It's funny cause I beat Signora yesterday after a gruelling 20 attempts with same level characters. 

Only the first phase feels legitimate now and even that was simply surviving for like 6 minutes. The second phase seems like a joke if your ult can recharge that fast. I'm so confused, am I missing something?? 

I know you can beat her every week in domains but if this is actually the archon fight in the quest, it was kind of disappointing. I was looking forward to getting beaten multiple times and gradually learning to dodge her and learn her moveset like I did with Signora, instead I finished the fight without even knowing it.

Hi! I just want to share my work on this recap/trailer of sorts if Genshin had recap/trailers for the game's Archon Quests.

Using resin to insta finish commissions||0
Hi, im an AR60 that already cleared everything. 100% all the areas (not literally but the number is there), done all the quest and what not during downtimes where im not busy. Now im busy asf but I need to do the commissions to get primos. I know that there are encounter points to make it faster which im grateful for. However there are times where i cant finish em. It would be great if i can press a button that does the commission in exchange for resin. It would get me the bare minimum primos while not affecting my IRL.

Is Scaramouche really that strong ?||0
Everyone hype him up as one of the most dangerous Harbingers but most of time, he prefers to use some tricks to deal with the Travellers and by the time he fought the Travellers, he uses robot to fight instead of fighting with his own powers and skills.

Childe and Signora at least fought the Travellers with their own powers and skills.

My opinions about the webgame||0
 So, it come to me thru reddit, there was this webgame about genshin and that it was quite challanging, so I decided to try it out. I played the whole thing, finished all the battles and got all the collectibles, and I wanted to share some criticism on my part.

1. The combat: The combat is pretty much Hollow Knight, no reason trying to deny that, now I personally like Hollow Knight and enjoy the game's combat, but it feels this choice for the webgame was a little \*weird\*. The fast paced gameplay is fine, but it felt kinda clunky, the timming of the attacks seemed inconsistent as well, which is very annoying to deal with if and made me lose focus sometimes, but besides that, I guess, it was okay.
2. Lack os sustain: Now, the problem of having a fast paced gamepley is, if you don't have any form of survivability, it makes mistakes feel way more punishing, specially if you are like right at the end of a battle (like Lyney's), and the boss does a new pattern and you get hit 'cause you don't know what to do. There is also the problem with the hitboxes, they are fine most of the time, but for some of the attacks, the boundaries of these hitboxes are not as easy to read, which make taking damage in those cases kinda annoying.
3. Lack of sighreability: Speaking of hitboxes, DON'T OVERDO THEM, a slash is not suposed to last 2 seconds neither should an explosion, what I mean is, it feels very unnatural trying to hit the enemy and getting hit because the animation for the cut was still there even if they finished slashing, it's very weird, and definitely unnecessary. Aside from the hitboxes, some attacks are also a little annoying to deal with, because there is no warning they'll do it in the first place, taking damage from an attack that has no warning in a fast paced game is just a little acceptable if you can heal yourself, use invencibility frames, or parry, something like that, but since there's no such thing in this webgame, it feels quite unfair.
4. The art: I can't recall a moment Genshin art failed, and this webgame is no different, I really liked the artstyle for this one, it's cute and very stylish, it made me wish there was more to play besides the 2 big bossfights, just to see else it had to offer.
5. The gameplay: As hard as it is, the webgame was still, quite enjoyable, like I said, I really like Hollow Knight, it's a very good game, and even if it's hard, it's very cool to play. I felt the same way playing this, besides the problems I mentioned, I like it a lot still, definitely would play it again just for the funzies, if this was a project to become a full game with more bosses and all, I would play it for sure, I would love to see other bossbattles, as well other contents in the game, like more combat options and reactions.

 To finish, my grade for this is 7.5/10, has it's flaws, but overall fun little experience, I reccomend if you don't have anything better to do, but if you feel like it's too hard for you, just don't play it then, getting mad over a game is not good for your health (besides the spirall abyss already exists for that anyway too). Those are my thoughts, what you guys thought about it?

Can the Suigetsu pool puzzle be bugged?||1
Recently, I was trying to help my friend getting some primogems for wishing and we came across the Suigetsu Pool Puzzle in Inazuma.   


I actually did the whole puzzle on my own a few months back and was confident that I could help him. I tried but saw a lot of the required mechanisms (like the relay stones and lightning strike probes) are missing in his world like not even there.  


I went back in my world and they were right there and couldn't figure out why they are not showing up for him. Is his world bugged? Or am I missing something?

On paper this seems fine right? Mine is c4 and I want a pyro DPS that's capable of some sort of self preservation like heals or shields and she seems great. And retracing bolide should be a good choice. Prototype amber and c4 with some ER so she can use the burst to heal a bit and keep a shield which doubles as a damage bonus.

125+ hrs into the game as a new genshin impact player - the quest conflict & co-op design is absurdly clunky & bad. Is this indicative of rest of game where I can’t click on anything random just stick to main quest first?||0
There’re many things that Genshin Impact does right and even great vs. other games even AAA open world games. Gonna start with listing random 3 positives as I don’t want to sound just negatively focused. The combat, music & world building is top notch. But the whole quest conflict & co-op/teapot locked until completing some random world quest is just infuriating. I think I understand why these restrictions happened initially in early game development as I’m guessing HoYo either lacked the technical expertise to have multiple instances and states for any given character/object or made a conscious decision… In which case I don’t understand…

Yes I know to not start character quests etc. But 3 examples I had that completely ruined the flow of the main story arc & experience for me so far (still on Act 2) are:

1)

Act Interlude, I had to go speak to Katherine the adventurer guild robot chick to essentially close out act 1 & go to Inazuma… Had to stop main quest suddenly because of conflict with wait for it… A daily commission that locked me out of the main questline as I had to complete a random daily commission that seemingly reserved Kathrine’s instance in the game state… WTF? 

2)

Act 2 prelude 

I finished act 1 & must’ve either accidentally or the game forces started multiple quests. I had to ping pong between the ship that sails you to Inazuma, the fighting arena & back on mainland Liyue because one of the random NPCs I needed to talk to in main quest was reserved for another quest that I didn’t even start or know about… This was a conflict between getting ready to sail to Inazuma vs. getting some sort of floating jade ore after the Liyue battle in ACT 1??? Worst part is having to not only fast travel because the quest locations but then traversing for 1-2 mins each time to get from nearest fast travel back to that quest location. Back and forth…

3

Teapot locked out because I randomly clicked on a statue to read something that ended up triggering a random world quest (needed to unlock 3 different areas to unlock the statue)… To then get back on with my intended gameplay experience…

controller doesn't work on pc, help||0
Hi!

I have an old ps3 controller (aerbes AB.-X008) and I recently downloaded genshin on my laptop (a brand new lenovo ideapad 1). I tried to connect the the controller and, althought the game recognizes that there's a controller, it doesn't respond to the commands. I tried to press the x to exit the menu and it didn't work: I had to press alt+f4, exit the game, close it and restart it in order to use the mouse/touchpad. 

Do you know any way I can make my controller work? I used to play on mobile but that's not an option anymore and using the touchpad is really terrible for me (walk/swim really badly and can't fight at all with the keyboard).

Thanks for your help :)

The end-game difficulty spike in Genshin has gotten ridiculous lately, but I DID IT!||1


[Harder than any Abyss 12 in Genshin](https://preview.redd.it/607v2z59nttc1.jpg?width=2828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=23970b689cff06f0d6fcdafcb7e78d8a2c124c43)

Never played a Metroidvania-type game before so it took a lot of git gud to complete.

Side-note: anyone know if it's possible to get the last HP buff if you didn't go left when you first got to Lyney (as far as I can tell from a guide)? I'm missing the last HP buff and it doesn't seem like you can get it anymore.

Do I have to start the game over again?

How many primogems  could get in one or two month  ||1
My friend spend my months saving of intertwined fates on Kazhu when I clearly said no,and rn I'm feeling depressed as I was saving for the probably return of Alhaitham in 4.7 version, wanting him from the first day of playing as aslo right now.
I got into a little fight as now I'm calculating,could I get the enough primogems to reach again my 100 intertwined fates or at least 60?
With the blessings of the welkin moon and daily mission+events until 4.7?
Neuvillette if he was actually good||5

Just beat floor 12||1
I'm AR 59 almost 60 and I just barely beat floor 12... Only two stars on each floor though (⁠￣⁠ヘ⁠￣⁠;⁠). I'm glad I finally atleast stood a chance at floor 12 though bcuz of Neuvillette... Just wanted to post cuz I'm happy I finally beat 12 though (⁠ ⁠╹⁠▽⁠╹⁠ ⁠).
First half my team was neuvi, ei, nahida, zhongli and second half was Navia, furina(only used for healing),xingqiu, xiangling. 
I'm not that good in building comps and stuff so all my builds are trash 😑
I figured I spent a lot of time in Spiral Abyss trying out different team comps and artifacts but this seems a bit much.(800+ attempts in a month)||1
