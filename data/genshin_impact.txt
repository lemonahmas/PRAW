Assign a Pokemon||0
I want to assign each character a Pokemon (for fan art), but I’m very uncreative. Let’s work together. Assign a Pokemon to your favorite characters. Could be aesthetic, lores, or anything (include explanation).

I’ll start with a few: Barbara-Primerina, Itto-Terrakion, Gaming-Pyroar, Diluc-Talonflame.
Thoughts?||0
I'm quite confused as to why some genshin players (or majority of them) still keeps coming back to the game after "quitting" or "deleting" the game, granted I'm not veteran player who played the game since released (I started playing since the release of sumeru). The common answers that I saw were "Genshin is boring now", "No upcoming endgame content or plans", "Genshin is dead",  "The game is not generous to keep playing it", "Genshin is getting repetitive", & "Hsr is much more fun and generous so I deleted genshin". And yet when a new character or a new area & nation releases they keep coming back to play the game and afterwards they "Quit" or "leave" the game "again". 

One counter argument they usually say is "I've invested so much money, time & effort in the game so I can't just quit" but then again they've keep "leaving" or "quitting" the game. Some or majority of them transferred to playing HSR because of the Generosity of HSR, more difficult endgame content, & easiness of grinding. I'm afraid that the true fans of HSR or the Honkai community in general will encounter a internal conflict with "Former" genshin players in HSR because "SOME" of the players that came from GI that started playing HSR got greedy when the hsr devs gives a free Dr. Ratio, abundance of Rewards from the anniversary and the players speculating a "free" aventurine (Which is very unlikely & unrealistic to happen). 

This is just my simple take or observations on the current situation of genshin players that are "quitting" or "leaving" the game.

Was Paimon always this loud?||0
For context, I started playing Genshin when it released and kept playing until 3.7, when I ultimately decided to take a long break (too much desert lol). I returned to the game around 2 weeks ago, and have been catching up with the story ever since. And man... Was Paimon always this loud?

Now I don't mean to say she's annoying. In fact, I've always been a Paimon apologist because I think she's really sweet, funny and very well portrayed as the Traveler's best friend and companion. But something that I've been noticing in the past few days is how whenever she speaks, my ears literally hurt. And I don't mean this as an hyperbole, I was legit flinching every time one of her lines started playing because of how constantly it goes high-pitch. It also feels like it gets worse because of the compression on the voice lines in general. Obviously every character's lines are compressed to an extent for the sake of space, but with Paimon, the very slight audio "cracks" are more noticeable, because of said high-pitch. Even lowering the volume didn't help much, I'm playing with the music volume on 7, whereas voice and sound effects are on 4. Still hard to hear. At this point I might need to lower my volume even further during cutscenes lol.

Was this always a thing? I remember that I bought my current headset about a month before taking a break from the game, so I \*did\* play it with the same headset back then for a while. Maybe I just didn't play any voiced quests in that period and thus didn't notice it. But holy cow, this little flying fairy must have a thing against eardrums.

Yo straight up, cat event is disappointing.||2719
I wanted to name the cat Tofu! Fuck you Paimon, sick of you naming everything.

Also it's supposed to be an event about putting furniture together for cats, but there's only one correct combination? What's the point? They could have made this like the Aranara event where you come mix and match the items. But if everybody just does the exact same thing why have us pick furniture at all?

Not to mention Mona and other characters that show up aren't even voiced, just lazy all around.

Petting the kitties is lacluster too.

I was hoping it'd be as good as the cooking event. =(

Can we all appreciate how Genshin handled a court trial so beautifully||3
Apparently, today's livestream announcement made me realise how close we are actually to Natlan and how majority of Fontaine's story is over.

One thing, I haven't seen being discussed is the trial side of all the quests. I have seen many shows and movies take on court proceedings in their plot and many have failed in it and many have passed. For Genshin tho, I was sceptical how would they handle it in game and with the theme of Opera.

I am so glad it was done this way. From, lighting to music to even dialogues everything was so good. I personally haven't attended any real trial so I don't know about realism part, but apart from that this was so well done. Like even the plot points, it was so thoroughly written well, it automatically became investing.

One little thing I catch here is, see how the court is divided here(refer the pic) by sides. What I mean is, who are or will be judged are always seated in the right, whereas who judges seats in the left. This shows, Furina who was although above all was also going to being judged at the end after all.

One more thing, notice how all of sumeru interlude was about deceiving the fate & how only a God can have a little chance of pulling it off, and the very next whole of Fontaine archon quest is actually that being pulled off.

Nevertheless, back to the topic, I am very happy and satisfied how the court proceedings were designed and written.

Ask about anything about the game that doesn't necessarily require a dedicated thread.

That is, if your question can be answered rather quickly/without significant  difficulty (e.g. "Can my phone run this game?"), ask here. If you think your question can contribute to some constructive discussions (e.g. "What do you think of Amber's combat efficiency? Here's my opinion."),  make a particular post with the "discussion" flair.

Heads up, you can get welkins for just 50p if you have a samsung device||136
On the first day of every month, you get a 90% off voucher in the galaxy store, this can be used on the welkin to get it for 50p. I've used this several times and almost got a year of welkin through it. I'm honestly not sure if this is UK exclusive but it's worth checking. Also you'll need to download genshin through the galaxy store to use the voucher.

Edit: It's located in a gift icon in the top right of the store page. Also while checking the app I got a 50% genshin coupon as well so there's even more offers to get as well

Would different kinds of resin be an improvement to the resin system?||0
The thing about the resin system I dislike a lot is how much you have to spend your resin on. Like what if you still haven't fought your weekly boss yet, but you also need to artifact farm for a character, and get weapon/talent ascension material only available that day? Having to selectively choose what to spend your small amount of resin on is so painful and really makes leveling your characters/weapons slower and harder. My proposal would be different resin for different kinds of resin gated challenges. 

Different Resins:

1. Weekly boss resin
2. resin for normal bosses
3. artifact domain resin
4. talent domain resin
5. weapon domain resin

I feel like this would be fair. 180 resin each could really help people get stuff done and be able to equally distribute their resources.

An interesting detail about Furina's eyelashes||1324
Her eyelashes look like the beaded eyelashes that were popular during the era of silent film. Beaded eyelashes were a popular but difficult-to-execute style of lashes in the 1920s. The technique consisted of melting a type of cosmetic eyelash coating or just straight-up black wax and applying beaded pieces of it to the ends of the eyelashes (real or fake) often with something like an orange wood stick.

And if you are wondering why? The answer is...expression! During the 1920s, films were still silent so there were no speaking parts. The actresses, (like Bebe Daniels) had to emote through their facial expressions. Lashes like these brought attention to their expressive eyes and greatly enhanced their performance.

These lashes are not only limited to the silver screen, stage actresses also often wear them to ensure that their faces are visible from the back of the audience and that the emotions that they are portraying are enhanced by their eyes.

IDK if it was intentional or not but a cool observation nonetheless given how her story has played out.

Honestly, it was kind of challenging but once I got the pattern and / or rotation down, I was able to clear with 3 stars in all parts. This is what happens when you dedicate stamina items for that. Though now I don't have stamina items, and the free grind trial is over for me lol

First line-up was with Kazuha, Furina, Ganyu (IK it's cope), Neuvillette (who has c1 and signature).

Second line-up was Fischl, Xingqiu, Zhongli, Navia. Navia is so strong, I know it's because of current biweekly effect, but her fully charged skill deals 100k+ damage, and she's not even fully leveled to 80 or 90, her weapon is still LV 70, talents level 6 though at least. The reason I used Xingqiu is because with him there was more consistency in getting full charges for Navia crystallize. Go Navia, go!

Anyways, I probably won't be able to do it again for the foreseeable future. It was possible due to current abyuss cycle, I'm sure it's not going to be the same again.

Account||0
Greetings, travelers. It's been well over a year since I last played my main account. It's locked and I want to retrieve it because I regained passion from playing after being burnt out.

Well, the story is, my Facebook account (which is the account binded with my main account) got disabled (ceased from activation). I really want this one back because of the progress I'd made. Could I have someone guide me into retrieving this back? I'm quite sure that it's still possible to be retrieved, since I've seen someone from other r/ made it happen. Albeit, I have no contact of the person and it was a couple years ago. 

That's all. May the gods guide you in your travels.

What about Genshin trailers||0
So I'll start by saying I love this game to death, I'm a player from day 1 and still enjoying the game and what it has to offer.
Recently with the blow at HSR and their new character, Acheron, I started playing the game again after I dropped it like half a year ago.
I really liked the theme, lore and gameplay they made for her.
And if I'm being completely honest, it made me jealous for the game I love so much.
Why is it that they go to such lengths with their teaser, demos and some characters even receiving fully animated trailers, they are more generous with their rewards to the players.
It feels like they are going doing more to their players in hsr and take us for granted.
Now I'm not saying that they are not putting any effort into the genshin, for example the Xianyun demo showed that they are going up in quality.
I guess I just can't help but compare the two since it's the same company, even if probably each game has their own departments.
But maybe someone can enlighten me with real and serious answers.

I've been requesting this in all survey suggetion for the past year.

I finally got the build I wanted for Klee. She can have improved but right now, I'm super happy! She's lv 90, 2 piece gladiator and 2 piece crimson witch with lv 90 lost prayers and she does great! She consistently does 20k charge attack with melt or vap. And a least 10k-15k on any other time. She has at least 2k attack. She finally good DPS status and can even take out enemies all on her own! My Klee might be average to some people but I'm so happy that the cutest character can hit like a truck! Even her skill is hitting 8k to 15k. I think I even saw 20k at one point. I feel so much joy at how amazing she's doing! She doesn't even have pyro goblet as I don't have a good on. I'm planning on maining her until AR 60 as I love her so much! She's my third fave and the cutest!! I just wanted to tell someone how happy I am with her and never regret pulling for her!!! Thanks for reading my rant lol.

The last stage of Rolling Crossfire is actually quite fun||3
The control of the event could be a little bit counter-intuitive at first, but you get used to it after playing for a while. On the other hand, the mechanism of **dynamic difficulty** adds extra challenge and learning curve to the last stage, meaning you could play it multiple times to gradually adapt and strategize, which therefore means some replay value. I feel like the event's gameplay could definitely be further fleshed out with more complexity and depth to make it a fun replayable minigame.

What's the highest score you've got in the last round? Took me quite a few tries to get to 20k and it feels like it would be much harder to grind for a higher score beyond the 20k point.

Hero the Copy Cat||0
Ok here is a very briefly thought out concept of a 5 star I have been thinking of for a while. Almost definitely overpowered, but I wanted to balance that by making them a weird fit. Basically I image them as being a sub DPS and Support at the same time. I also want them to be from the new Pyro Nation along with this other character I have been thinking about to a much more in depth degree. Please tell me what you think about Hero! I really like the idea behind them but understand it would be hard to balance and implement.

Hero the Copy Cat (Cryo Catalyst, they/them)
- [ ] Normal attack: Makes ice versions of the physical weapons. 6 hit chain. First 2 are the sword, second 2 are spear, last 2 are a claymore.
- [ ] Charged attack: Freezes the air into an ice bow, rapidly charging a magic ice arrow. After charging like a normal bow, the arrow will create 3 ice clusters around the tip. When fired, the arrow will split into 3 homing projectiles.
- [ ] Plunging attack: Standard catalyst plunge, but upon landing there is an AOE visual effect of a mini Rosaría’s ult (no extra damage).
- [ ] Elemental Skill: Creates a small area of effect that enhances attack speed of allies within. Upon dealing damage, the active character (something you do with the Pyro Nation’s gimmick). Lasts for 6 seconds. Cooldown is 8 seconds.
- [ ] Burst: Calls upon their allies, imbuing their experiences and knowledge into ice sculptures the hero makes. Upon creation, these figures become animated and cast their elemental skills. These skills, however, become imbued with the cryo element (Furina’s summons will deal cryo damage instead of hydro). This resets cooldowns for the full team’s elemental skill. Increases damage of the skill by 150% for duration. If skill is used by the original character it will replace the current skill effects on the field (ie. If Furina takes the field after this ult and summons her pals, they will replace the cryo versions.) (If used in coop and there is more than one Hero on the team, then the inactive hero will be summoned to use their skill. If there is no inactive Hero [ie. both Hero’s are on the field] then no Hero copy will be created)
- [ ] Passive 1: The weapons summoned by Hero’s basic and charged attack become visual copies of their ally’s equipped weapons. This also grants a weakened version of those weapons’ passives the this character. If there are two units with the same type of weapon, one weapon will be chosen at random for the chain.
- [ ] Passive 2: The copies summoned by the burst will now stay around for a max of 5 secs where they will auto attack surrounding enemies using cryo versions of their weapons (deals only cryo damage and gains the weakened passive of their weapon. Hero cannot utilize Passive 1 until the copies fade. These copies have half the strength of the real versions. Can be destroyed if HP is reduced to 0) (This effect will not summon other versions of Hero. If there are two Hero’s on the team, the inactive Hero will be summoned, use their skill, then fade as if the active Hero did not have Passive 2. If there is no inactive Hero on the team, then no copy of Hero will be summoned).
- [ ] C1: If the full team is catalyst users, then Hero will summon only basic weapons, but their catalyst will switch between their allies’ catalysts for each of their 6 attacks (random order, always retains their original weapon’s passive). Charge attack is still the same. Passive 1 grants the full passive of the allies’ weapons to Hero.
- [ ] C2: Basic attack up 3 levels
- [ ] C3: 
- [ ] C4: 
- [ ] C5: Burst up 3 levels
- [ ] C6: Perfect Imitation. Each weapon Hero summons due to Passive 1 becomes a r5 version while Hero has it summoned. The stats of the passive are no longer weakened by the effects of Passive 1. Hero also adopts the fighting animation for their current teammates.
- [ ] Signature Weapon: Main stat= ATK. Passive= Gain stat buff for each team member with a different weapon type. Gain different stat buff for each unit with the same weapon type (catalyst)
- [ ] Idle animation: summons the cryo copies of their current teammates and poses with them to take a selfie.

Predicting future patches in Genshin Impact.||0
I wipped up a little chart on what each patch will contain in a future series of patches. I looked at previous series, and used patterns that I've seen in 2.x, 3.x, and 4.x. I didn't put in much consideration from 1.x because it's an outlier when it comes to the other patches. I put a picture of iansan in the background because the next series is 5.x, but this also applies to future series as well. This chart is going off of if a patch has an archon quest and or a new region to explore. I just call patches that have both god patches.

I pulled this from a video I made. Though the topic slightly differs from this one, it'll give you more context to how I made the chart. The video is about how common filler patches are in genshin. You can watch it here. [https://youtu.be/IPP286NJga0?si=ChBimzvCfFEDV1yt](https://youtu.be/IPP286NJga0?si=ChBimzvCfFEDV1yt)

What are best Genshin Impact slander names?||389
We all love this game and thats why we’re here. No offense to anyone but sometimes we do get frustrated due to bad luck in gacha rng, Abyss runs or other bad luck in this game that makes some people create hilarious slander names. 

I saw one recently thats making me laugh out anytime I think of it, “Emblem of severe shit domain” 😂😂😂

The other one that stuck to me for a long time was “Staff of homeless” before they brought the weapon banner pity system

What are other funny slander names that you’ve seen or thought about yourselves?
